anna,I like fast!,3
anna,"Ew! No, I was raised in a castle.",8
anna,"Oh well, it was all my fault. I...I got engaged, but then she freaked out because I'd only just met him, you know, that day. And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage, and...",34
anna,"Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove...",22

cinderella,"Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.  Come, kitty. C'mon.  Lucifer! Come here!  I'm sorry if Your Highness objects to an early breakfast.  It's certainly not my idea to feed you first. It's orders. C'mon.",33
cinderella,"Bruno... Bruno!  Dreaming again. Chasing Lucifer?  Catch him this time?  That's bad.  Suppose they heard you upstairs? You know the orders. Then if you don't want to lose a nice warm bed, you'd better get rid of those dreams. Know how?  Just learn to like cats.  No, I mean it. Lucifer has his good points as well. For one fact, he... Well... sometimes he... Huh... There must be something good about him.  Bruno! Oh, Bruno. C'mon now, outside.  I know it isn't easy, but at least we should try to get along together.  And that includes you, Your Majesty!  Breakfast time! Everybody up! Hurry up, hurry up! C'mon, everybody. Breakfast, breakfast!",111

cinderella,Thank you.,2
cinderella,"I don't know. He said it's urgent.  Perhaps I should interrupt the, uh...music lesson.",14
cinderella,But this just arrived from the palace.,7
cinderella,"Why, that means I can go as well!",8
cinderella,"Well, why not? After all, I'm yet a member of the family. And it says, ""by royal command, every eligible maiden is to attend.""",24
cinderella,"Oh, I will! I promise.",5
cinderella,"I'm sure I can! Oh, thank you, Stepmother.",8
cinderella,Isn't it lovely? It was my mother's.,7

cinderella,Wait a moment.  There ought to be some good ideas in here.  Uh-huh. This one.,15
cinderella,"Yes, I'll have to shorten the sleeves, I'll need a sash, a ruffle, and something for a collar. And then I'll---",21

elsa,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight, not a footprint to be seen. A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the Queen. The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside. Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried. Don't let them in, don't let them see, Be the good girl you always have to be. Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know.  Well, now they know! Let it go. Let it go. Can't hold it back anymore!  Let it go. Let it go. Turn away and slam the door. I don't care what they're going to say. Let the storm rage on. The cold never bothered me anyway.  It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small. And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all. It's time to see what I can do, to test the limits and break through.  No right, no wrong, no rules for me. I'm free!  Let it go! Let it go! I am one with the wind and sky. Let it go! Let it go! You'll never see me cry! Here I stand and here I'll stay!  Let the storm rage on...  My power flurries through the air into the ground. My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around.  And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast. I'm never going back, the past is in the past!  Let it go! Let it go!  And I'll rise like the break of dawn. Let it go! Let it go! That perfect girl is gone.  Here I stand in the light of day!

merida,"Some say our destiny is tied to the land, as much a part of us as we are of it. Others say fate is woven together like a cloth, so that one’s destiny intertwines with many others. It’s the one thing we search for, or fight to change. Some never find it. But there are some who are led. The story of how my father lost his leg to the demon bear, Mor’du, became legend. I became a sister to three new brothers, the princes. Hamish, Hubert and Harris. Wee devils more like. They get away with murder! I can never get away with anything!  I’m the princess.

merida,"The story of this kingdom is a powerful one. My dad railed your forces and you made him your king. It was an alliance forged in bravery and friendship and it lives to this day. I’ve been selfish. I tore a great rift in our kingdom. There’s no one to blame but me. And I know now that I need to amend my mistake and mend our bond. And so, there is the matter of my betrothal. I decided to do what’s right, and…  And…And break…Tradition.  My mother, the queen, feels…Uh, in her heart, that I…That we be free to…Write our own story. Follow our hearts, and find love in our time.",112

Will you take me there? I like it here. Ooh, it's dark inside. Guess there's no one home. Hello, may I come in? Shh.  What a cute little chair. Why there's 7 little chairs. Must be 7 little children. And from the look of this table, 7 untidy little children. A pick-axe! A stocking, too!  And a shoe! And just look at that fireplace. It's covered with dust. And look, cobwebs everywhere. My, my, my!
