CUT TO: EXT. OCEAN

On June 25, 1824, Three seagulls fly through gray clouds then swoop down over the ocean. Below, three smiling dolphins leap through the waves in arcing jumps porpoises are swimming happily. The three dolphins stop and a seagull flies beside them on the surface.

Behind them, a sailing ship looms through the mist, crashing through the waves. The ship's huge wooden prowl heads straight towards the viewers and cruises past.

On board, burly sailors haul in a net full of fish from the water.

"Fathoms Below"
SAILORS: (Singing) I'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue And it's hey to the starboard, heave ho Look out, lad, a mermaid be waitin' for you In mysterious fathoms below.

A dark-haired young man stands on deck.

ERIC: Isn't this great? The salty sea air, the wind blowing in your face... a perfect day to be at sea!

GRIMBSY: (face green and leaning over the side of the ship to vomit all over the sea) Oh yes.. delightful...

SAILOR 1: A fine strong wind and a following sea. King Triton must be in a friendly-type mood.

ERIC: King Triton?

SAILOR 2: Why, ruler of the merpeople, lad. Thought every good sailor knew about him.

GRIMSBY: Merpeople! Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense.

SAILOR 2: (wildly waving a fish in Grimsby's face) But it ain't nonsense, it's the truth! I'm tellin' you, down in the depths o' the ocean they live.

SAILORS: (singing)

Heave. ho. Heave, ho.

In mysterious fathoms below.

GRIMSBY: Ohhh!!! Uhhh!!!

The fish in his hand wiggles away and lands back in the ocean, relieved. He stops for a breath then speeds down, leaving a trail of silvery bubbles behind him.

"Little Mermaid Main Title"
Titles roll in shimmering letters as various fish swim and seaweed sways gently. The camera follows the escaped fish as it makes it's way through the ocean. Near the ocean floor a whale swims with two calfs.

In a landscape of coral and seaweed, merpeople swim. They speed over the ocean floor, gently slipping their flipper tails. Swimming through a tunnel, they reach a great palace with pearls decorating it's front gates. They swim inside and take their seats filling the concert hall inside.

"Fanfare"
Fish with trumpet like noses play a fanfare. A tiny seahorse with a ruffled collar appears. He coughs before he speaks.

SEAHORSE: His royal highness, King Triton!

Triton enters dramatically, being pulled on a seashell chariot by a trio of dolphins to wild cheering. Sparks shoot from his trident and light a chandelier.

SEAHORSE: And presenting the distinguished court composer, Horatio Thelonious Ignatius Crustaceous Sebastian!

A fanfare of kazoos play. Sebastian the Crab, enters riding a small seashell chariot being pulled by two orange fish. He is met with mild applause. He pulls up beside King Triton.

TRITON: I'm really looking forward to this performance, Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN: Oh, Your Majesty, this will be the finest concert I have ever conducted. Your daughters - they will be spectacular!

The fish flip in small seashell chariot with Sebastian upside down.

TRITON: Yes, and especially my little Ariel.

SEBASTIAN: Yes, yes, she has the most beautiful voice. Hmm? (under his breath) If only she'd show up for rehearsals once in a while...

A spotlight appears over Sebastian and he rides his small seashell chariot out over the stage and takes his place at the podium. He takes out a book of music. He taps his baton and directs the orchestra of fish.

"Daughters of Triton"
The sisters swim out of giant clam shells as they sing.

TRITON'S DAUGHTERS: Ah, we are the daughters of Triton.

Great father who loves us and named us well:

Aquata, Andrina, Arista, Attina, Adella, Alana.

And then there is the youngest in her musical debut,

Our seventh little sister, we're presenting her to you,

To sing a song Sebastian wrote, her voice is like a bell,

She's our sister, Ari -

A shell rises as the sisters surround it. It opens to reveal that Ariel is absent. The sisters and Sebastian look worried.

TRITON: (angrily shouting) ARIEL!!!

"Ariel opening"
CUT TO: EXT. SUNKEN SHIPWRECK


FLOUNDER: (from a distance) Ariel, wait for me...

ARIEL: (waving him over) Flounder, hurry up!

FLOUNDER: (catching up) You know I can't swim that fast.

ARIEL: (pointing to a sunken ship) There it is. Isn't it fantastic?

FLOUNDER: Yeah... sure... it - it's great. Now let's get outta here.

Flounder the Fish begins to swim away and Ariel yanks his tail towards her.

ARIEL: You're not getting cold fins now, are you?

Ariel swims towards the ship. Flounder follows after her.

FLOUNDER: Who, me? No way. It's just, it, err... it looks - damp in there. Yeah. And I think I may be coming down with something. Yeah, I got this cough.

Flounder coughs unconvincingly.

ARIEL: All right. I'm going inside. You can just stay here and - watch for sharks.

Ariel swims inside through a porthole.

FLOUNDER: O.K. Yeah - you go. I'll stay and - (suddenly realizing what she said) what? Sharks! Ariel! (He tries to squeeze through the porthole, but gets stuck.) Ariel... I can't... I mean- Ariel, help!

ARIEL: (laughs) Oh, Flounder.

FLOUNDER: (whispering) Ariel, do you really think there might be sharks around here?

(Ariel comes back to help him.)

ARIEL: Flounder, don't be such a guppy.

(A huge shark passes behind them as Flounder squeezes in.)

FLOUNDER: I'm not a guppy. (nervously) This is great - I mean, I really love this. Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around every corn- (He sees a skull and screams. He crashes into a pillar, causing wooden beams to fall down.) Ariel! (He swims frantically away, knocking over Ariel.)

ARIEL: Oh, are you okay?

(Flounder shakes intensely.)

FLOUNDER: Yeah sure, no problem, I'm okay...

ARIEL: Shhh... (She swims to an upper level of the ship. Resting atop a heap is a silver fork.) Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! (picking up a fork called dinglehopper) Have you ever seen anything so wonderful in your entire life?

FLOUNDER: Wow, cool! But, err, what is it?

ARIEL: I don't know. But I bet Scuttle will. (She puts the fork in her orange bag. The shark swims by outside.)

FLOUNDER: What was that? Did you hear something?

ARIEL: (distracted by a pipe called snarfblatt) Hmm, I wonder what this one is?

FLOUNDER: Ariel . .

ARIEL: Flounder, will you relax. Nothing is going to happen.

(The shark appears in front of the window, behind Flounder, jaws wide open. He chomps down on the glass.)

FLOUNDER: Ahh! Run! Run! We're gonna die!

(The shark bangs his head on the ceiling of the ship. He chases Ariel and Flounder and they swim for an upper deck. Flounder screams as the shark breaks through the floor with chest, chomping towards them. Ariel's orange bag gets caught on a plank and she goes back for it. Flounder swims towards a porthole and gets stuck again.)

FLOUNDER: Oh no!

(Ariel pushes Flounder through and wriggles out behind him. He screams as the shark bursts through the wall and chases them around the ships'. Flounder bumps into a crossbeam. The shark lunges towards him, but misses as he sinks towards the bottom with a dazed look. Ariel spots him and swims down to get him, dropping her bag. The shark races towards them, but his head gets stuck in the ring of an anchor. Ariel picks up her bag, which has landed near her.)

FLOUNDER: You big bully.

(Flounder blows a raspberry. The shark snaps at him and he swims with Ariel towards the surface.)

ARIEL: (laughing) Flounder, you really are a guppy.

FLOUNDER: I am not.

"Ursula opening"'
CUT TO: EXT. SURFACE

On a tiny island, Scuttle the Seagull hums a song and looks through his telescope.

SCUTTLE: (singing) 1492, dah-de-dum dee-do-do, rum-dim-dim, dee-do-dee-do

Scuttle sticks his telescope on his head.

ARIEL: Scuttle!

SCUTTLE: (looking through the telescope the wrong way, making Ariel appear farther away, shouting) Whoa! Mermaid off the port bow! Ariel, how you doin' kid?!

Scuttle lowers the telescope to reveal Ariel at wing's length

SCUTTLE: Whoa, what a swim!

ARIEL: Scuttle - look what we found.

Ariel pulls up her bag and hands it to Scuttle.

FLOUNDER: Yeah - we were in this sunken ship - it was really creepy.

SCUTTLE: Human stuff, huh? Hey, lemme see.

Scuttle drops an anchor. It catches on his foot and knocks him off his perch. Rummaging through Ariel's bag, he takes out the fork.

SCUTTLE: Oh! Oh! Look at this. Wow - this is special - this is very, very unusual.

ARIEL: What? What is it?

SCUTTLE: It's a dinglehopper! Humans use these little babies... to straighten their hair out.

Scuttle twirls the fork around his feathers.

SCUTTLE: See - just a little twirl here an' a yank there and - voilee!

Scuttles feathers go up in a poof

SCUTTLE: You got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over.

Scuttle hands the fork back to Ariel.

ARIEL: A dinglehopper!

FLOUNDER: (in reference to the pipe) What about that one?

SCUTTLE: (picking up the pipe) Ah - this I haven't seen in years. This is wonderful! A banded, bulbous - snarfblatt.

ARIEL & FLOUNDER: (turning to each other) Ohhh

SCUTTLE: Now, the snarfblatt dates back to pre-historical times, when humans used to sit around, and stare at each other all day. Got very boring. So, they invented the snarfblatt to make fine music. Allow me.

Scuttle blows into the pipe. Seaweed and sand pops out the other end.

ARIEL: (mortified) Music?

SCUTTLE: (coughing with sand and seaweed) It's stuck!

ARIEL: Oh, the concert! Oh my gosh, my father's going to kill me!

FLOUNDER: The concert was today?

SCUTTLE: (still contemplating on the pipe) Maybe you could make a little planter out of it or somethin'.

ARIEL: (snatching the pipe hurriedly) Uh, I'm sorry, I've gotta go. Thank you, Scuttle.

Ariel waves and dives into the water with Flounder.

SCUTTLE: Anytime, sweetie. Anytime.

Scuttle waves back as the camera zooms away.

CUT TO: EXT. UNDER OCEAN WATERS

Ariel and Flounder swim down. Eels Flotsam and Jetsam slither out from under a rock ledge. The reflection of Ariel and Flounder swimming in the bright yellow eyes of the pair merge together, forming a projection on Ursula's magical bubble. Back in her lair, Ursula watches her.

URSULA: Yes, hurry home, princess. We wouldn't want to miss old daddy's celebration, now, would we? Ha! Celebration indeed. Bah! In my day, we had fantastical feasts when I lived in the palace.

Ursula picks up a scared little squeaky shrimp and eats him.

URSULA: And now, look at me - wasted away to practically nothing - banished and exiled and practically starving, while he and his flimsy fish-folk celebrate.

Ursula extends her tentacles and floats down to the bottom of her lair.

URSULA: Well, I'll give 'em something to celebrate soon enough. Flotsam! Jetsam!

The camera cuts to the two eels, who can magically hear Ursula. Jetsam hits his head on the rock ledge.

URSULA: I want you to keep an extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his. She may be the key to Triton's undoing...

The scene darkens, leaving only Ursula's white eyes before completely going black.

"Triton Reprimanded Ariel"
CUT TO: INT. THRONE ROOM

King Triton sits on his throne with Sebastian by his shoulder as he admonishes Ariel. Flounder watches from afar worriedly.

TRITON: I just don't know what we're going to do with you, young lady!

ARIEL: Daddy, I'm sorry, I just forgot, I -

TRITON: As a result of your careless behavior -

SEBASTIAN: (poking out between Triton's crown and interjecting) Careless and reckless behavior!

TRITON: - the entire celebration was, er -

SEBASTIAN: (poking out between Triton's beard and interjecting once again) Well, it was ruined! That's all. Completely destroyed! This concert was to be, the pinnacle of my distinguished career. Now thanks to you I am the laughingstock of the entire kingdom!

FLOUNDER: (rushing out to confront Sebastian angrily) But it wasn't her fault! (nervously speaking as he realizes what he's gotten himself into) Ah - well - first, ahh, this shark chased us - yeah - yeah! And we tried to-

King Triton and Sebastian look to one another, raising a brow, unconvinced.

FLOUNDER: But we couldn't - and - (growls)- and - and we - (spinning around) whoooaaaaaa - oh, and then we were

safe. But then this seagull came, and it was this is this, and that is that, and -

TRITON: Seagull?

Flounder gasps, putting his fins up to his mouth, realizing he gave Ariel away. Flounder hides behind Ariel as she looks back angrily at him.

TRITON: (rising from his throne) What?! Oh - you went up to the surface again, didn't you?! Didn't you?!

Ariel backs up, wide-eyed.

ARIEL: (shrugging) Nothing - happened...

TRITON: (slapping his hand to his face and growled at me) Oh, Ariel, how many times must we go through this?! You could've been seen by one of those barbarians - by - by one of those humans!

ARIEL: Daddy, they're not barbarians!

TRITON: They're dangerous. (picking up Ariel's chin and looking at his eye) Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter snared by some fish-eater's hook?!

ARIEL: (backing away and shaking her head) I'm sixteen years old - I'm not a child anymore -

TRITON: (wagging his finger angrily) Don't you take that tone of voice with me young lady!

ARIEL: Well-

TRITON: As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules!

ARIEL: If- But if you would just listen -

TRITON: (turning away) Not another word! And I am never, never to hear of you going to the surface again! Is that clear?!

Ariel's lip quivers. She exhales and swims away with Flounder tailing behind.

Triton sits on his throne and rests his head in his hand.

SEBASTIAN: Hm! Teenagers... They think they know everything. You give them an inch; they swim all over you.

TRITON: (with a concerned expression) Do you, er, think I... I was too hard on her?

SEBASTIAN: Definitely not. Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was boss. None of this "flitting to the surface" and other such nonsense. No, sir, I'd keep her under tight control.

Triton rubs his chin and suddenly has a lightbulb moment.

TRITON: You're absolutely right, Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN: (arms crossed) Of course.

TRITON: Ariel needs constant supervision.

SEBASTIAN: Constant.

TRITON: Someone to watch over her - to keep her out of trouble.

SEBASTIAN: All the time -

TRITON: (poking Sebastian in the belly) And you are just the crab to do it.

Sebastian's eyes go wide

CUT TO: INT. PALACE HALLS

Sebastian jitters down the palace halls, mumbling to himself.

SEBASTIAN: How do I get myself into these situations? I should be writing symphonies, not tagging along after some headstrong teenager.

He sees Ariel and Flounder sneaking off and follows.

SEBASTIAN: Hmm? What is that girl up to?

Sebastian follows them, panting and flapping his claws. He stops to rest. Ahead of him, Ariel rolls back a large rock, revealing an opening to a cave. She looks around to make sure no one is around and swims inside with Flounder.

As Sebastian tries to slip in behind them, the rock rolls shut on his legs. He pulls himself free and bounces into the cave, bumping into an hourglass. He looks around, aghast, at the walls of the grotto, seeing a vast collection of human objects.

"Part of Your World"
Ariel lays on a rock with a fork and Flounder looks on with a worried expression.

FLOUNDER: Ariel, are you okay?

ARIEL: If only I could make him understand.

Sebastian covers his mouth in disbelief.

ARIEL: I just don't see things the way he does. I just don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things - could be b

ARIEL: (Singing) Look at this stuff

Isn't it neat?

Wouldn't you thank my collection's complete?

She puts the fork away in the silverware stand

Wouldn't you thank I'm the girl

The girl who has everything?

Look at this trove

Treasures untold

How many wonders can one cavern hold?

Lookin' aroun here you' thank

Sure, she's got everything I got gadgets and gizmos aplenty

I got whozits and whatzits galore (

Sebastion is wearing glasses

You want thingamabobs? (Ariel is opening up a case with 20 seashells)

I got 20

But who cares?

No big deal

I want more

I wanna be where the people are

I wanna see

Wanna see 'em dancin'

Walkin' around on those (Ariel is spinning the dancing music box)

What do ya call 'em?

Oh - feet

Flippin' your fins you don't get too far

Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'

Strollin' along down a

What's that word again? Street

Up where they walk

Up where they run

Up where they stay all day in the sun

Wanderin' free

Wish I could be

Part of that world

What would I give

If I could live

Out of these waters? (Sebastian screams and go inside the beer stein)

What would I pay

To spend a day

Warm on the sand?

Betcha on land

They understand

Bet they don't reprimand their daughters

Bright young women

Sick of swimmin'

Ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know (Ariel is reading a book. Sebastian rolls the beer stein.)

Ask 'em my questions

And get some answers

What's a fire and why does it (Ariel is looking for the portrait of a lady with a candle)

What's the word?

Burn?

When's it my turn?

Wouldn't I love

Love to explore that shore up aboooooove?

Out of the sea

Wish I could be

Part of that

Wooooooooooorld

Sebastian comes tumbling out of a beer stein falling on top of a jack-in-the-box. As he grabs a tablecloth, various things come crashing down on top of him. Flounder hides inside a helmet, startled by the commotion.

ARIEL: Sebastian!?

SEBASTIAN: Ariel - what, are you mad?! How could you and what is all this?!

ARIEL: It's... uh, it's just my - collection.

SEBASTIAN: (holding up a fishhook and speaking sarcastically) Oh. I see. Your collection, hmmm. IF YOUR FATHER KNEW ABOUT THIS PLACE-

FLOUNDER: You're not gonna tell him, are you?!

ARIEL: Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand.

SEBASTIAN: Ariel. You're under a lot of pressure down here. (taking Ariel's hand in his claw and leading her away) Come with me, I'll take you home and get you something warm to drink.

The shadow of a ship passes by overhead.

ARIEL: What do you suppose?

SEBASTIAN: Ariel? Ariel!

"Fireworks"/"Jig"
Ariel swims out of the grotto and up towards a ship. Above the surface, fireworks explode in the sky around the ship. Ariel gasps and looks on, amazed. Sebastian and Flounder surface beside her.

SEBASTIAN: Ariel, what - what are you- (gasping) Jumpin' jellyfish!

Ariel leaps to the ship.

SEBASTIAN: Ariel, Ariel! Please come back!

Ariel climbs up the ship and watches party on board eyelevel at the deck. Three sailors play music as the others dance a jig. Max, a shaggy sheepdog barks and scampers around the dancers.

Max sniffs along the deck towards Ariel and licks Ariel's face. Prince Eric whistles to Max.

ERIC: (whistles) Max, here boy.

Max runs to Eric. Ariel touches her cheek where Max licked her.

ERIC: Hey, come on, mutt, whatcha doing, huh Max? Good boy, good boy.

Max jumps on Eric and barks. Ariel sees him and is lovestruck. Scuttle flaps down towards her, speaking loudly.

SCUTTLE: Hey there, sweetie! Quite a show, eh?

ARIEL: (speaking low) Scuttle, be quiet! They'll hear you!

SCUTTLE: Oooh, I gotcha, I gotcha. (hiding beside Ariel) We're being intrepidatious. (now shouting) We're out to discover!

Ariel grabs his beak to shut him up.

ARIEL: I've never seen a human this close before.

Eric plays the flute.

ARIEL: Oh - he's very handsome, isn't he?

SCUTTLE: (looking at Max) I dunno, he looks kinda hairy and slobbery to me.

ARIEL: Not that one - the one playing the snarfblat.

GRIMSBY: (holding his arms out) Silence! Silence! It is now my honor and privilege to present our esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday present.

Grimsby gestures towards a large object covered in cloth and tied with a red ribbon.

ERIC: (knocking Grimsby on the back) Ah, Grimsby - y'all beanpole, you shouldn't have.

Sailors cheer and whistle.

GRIMSBY: I know. Happy birthday, Eric!

A large, gaudy statue of Eric as a mighty warrior stepping atop a giant royal crest is revealed. Max growls.

ERIC: Gee, Grim. It's... uhh, it's... uh - it's really somethin'.

GRIMSBY: Yes, I commissioned it myself. Of course, I had hoped it would be a wedding present, but...

"The Storm"
ERIC: (grabbing the telescope from Grimsby) Aw, come on, Grim, don't start. Look, you're not still sore because I didn't fall for the princess of Glowerhaven, are you?

Eric looks out the telescope for a second before tossing it back to Grimsby, who catches it clumsily.

GRIMSBY: Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone. The entire kingdom wants to see you happily settled down with the right girl.

Eric sits on the railing of the ship looking out towards the sea.

ERIC: Well, she's out there somewhere. I just - I just haven't found her yet.

GRIMSBY: Well, perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough.

ERIC: Believe me, Grim, when I find her I'll know - without a doubt. It'll just - bam! - hit me - like lightning.

Grimsby and Eric look up to the sky as thick clouds of lightning and thunder appear and the sky grows dark for a hurricane.

SAILOR: Hurricane a'commin'! Stand fast! Secure the riggin'!

Eric and the sailors run to different parts of the deck as rain starts to fall and giant waves swell up, rocking the ship. The crew pulls hard on ropes tied to a sail.

In the ocean, a wave crashes over Flounder and Sebastian. On board, Scuttle holds onto a rope.

SCUTTLE: Whoa! The wind's all of a sudden on the move here.

A gust of hurricane wind blows Scuttle away.

SCUTTLE: Yo! Ariel!

On board, the captain tries to hold onto the ship's wheel, but it spins out of his hands. The ship crashes through storm and a wave passes over the deck. Eric runs tot he wheel and grabs it.

On the side of the ship, Ariel loses her grip on the ropes and falls into the water. Swimming underneath, she swims up the stern and sees a flash of lightning hit a sail catching fire. A fire breaks out, and the ship looms towards jutting rocks. Ariel gapes.

ERIC: (pointing ahead) Look out!...

The ship rams into the rocks and all are thrown overboard, except Max. Eric's statue sinks down the waves beside Grimsby coughing, who flaps his arms about.

ERIC: Grim, hang on!

Eric pulls him into a lifeboat, then sees Max still on the ship. The dog barks as flames flash in front of him.

ERIC: Max!

Eric dives back into the water and climbs up the side of the burning ship, smelling like barbecue. As he leaps onto the deck, one of the masts breaks and crashes down. Eric leaps out of the way. Flames spread.

Max stands on a ledge and Eric holds his arms wide, beckoning the dog.

ERIC: Jump Max! Come on boy, jump! You can do it Max.

Max jumps onto his arms. As Eric runs across the deck, his foot breaks through a plank and gets stuck. He jolts forward and Max splashes into the water and swims to the lifeboat.

On board, Eric struggles to free himself as the flames with black/red smoke grow.

Grimsby pulls Max on board and looks for Eric.

GRIMSBY: Eric!

Eric looks over deck. The flames reach a barrel of gunpowder and the ship explodes with black/red smoke. The sailors and Grimsby look on from their lifeboat, staring in horror. Ariel swims to the ship to find Eric. He floats on a board, unconscious and rolls off, sinking into the water. Ariel dives down to grab him and swims to the surface. The fireworks returns above the black/red smoke into the burning ship.

CUT TO: EXT. BEACH SHORE

On the beach, Eric lies on his back, unconscious, with Ariel leaning over him. Scuttle lands beside them.

ARIEL: Is he - dead?

Scuttle opens Eric's eyelid.

SCUTTLE: It's hard to say.

Scuttle puts his ear against Eric's foot.

SCUTTLE: Oh, I - I can't make out a heartbeat.

ARIEL: No, look! He's breathing. (moving his hair from his face, gazing) He's so beautiful.

"Part of Your World (Reprise)"
ARIEL: (Singing) What would I give

To live where you are?

What would I pay

To stay here beside you?

Sebastian and Flounder have washed up. They watch as Ariel caresses Eric's cheek. Sebastian drops his jaw in disbelief and Scuttle closes it.

What would I do to see you

Smiling at me?

Where would we walk?

Where would we run?

If we could stay all day in the sun

Just you and me

And I could be

Part of your world

The sun parts through the gray clouds leftover from hurricane and Eric's eyes flutter open as he touches Ariel's hand, only seeing her waist up. He watches as the golden sunlight lights up behind her. Max barks and runs to lick Eric's face. Grimsby approaches and she dives into the water.

GRIMSBY: Eric! Oh, Eric. You really delight in these sadistic strains on my blood pressure, don't you?

Grimsby helps Eric up and he shakes his head.

ERIC: A girl - rescued me... She was - singing... she had the most - beautiful voice.

GRIMSBY: Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed a bit too much seawater. Off we go. Come on, Max.

Max stands in the water, barking towards Ariel and her friends.

SEBASTIAN: (to Flounder) We just gotta forget this whole thing ever happened. The sea king will never know. You won't tell him, I won't tell him. I will stay in one piece.

"Part of Your World (Reprise)" CONT.
Ariel hoists herself upon a rock to watch Eric leave.

ARIEL: (Singing) I don't know when

I don't know how

But I know something's starting right now

Watch and you'll see

Some day I'll be

Part of your

Wooooooooorld!

Behind her, Flotsam and Jetsam rise from the water.

CUT TO: INT. URSULA'S LAIR

Ursula watches Ariel through a magical bubble.

URSULA: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I can't stand it - it's too easy! The child is in love with a human. And not just any human - a prince! (sarcastically) Her daddy'll love that. King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl would make a charming addition to my little garden.

On June 29, 1824, attached to the floor, hundreds of shriveled polyps squirming and shaking. Ursula laughs evilly. The next morning comes as fishes swim by.

"Ariel's In Love"
CUT TO: EXT. ATLANTICA PALACE

CUT TO: INT. MERSISTER'S DRESSING ROOM

ANDRINA: Ariel, dear, time to come out. You've been in there all morning.

Ariel emerges from behind a curtain, humming "Part of Your World" to herself.

ATTINA: What is with her lately?

Ariel picks a red flower and swims away. She bumps into her father.

ARIEL: Morning, Daddy.

Ariel puts the flower in his hair and swims off, spinning in circles. He chuckles.

ATTINA: Oh, she's got it bad.

TRITON: What? What has she got?

ANDRINA: Isn't it obvious, Daddy? Ariel's in love.

TRITON: Ariel? In love?

King Triton picks the flower from his hair and looks at it.

CUT TO: EXT. UNDERSEA ROCKS

Sebastian paces on a rock.

SEBASTIAN: O.K. So far, so good. I don't think the king knows.

Orange flower petals fall around Sebastian by Ariel. One lands on his face and he blows it off.

SEBASTIAN: But it will not be easy keeping something like this a secret for long.

The camera rises up to reveal Ariel picking flowers.

ARIEL: He loves me... hmmm, he loves me not... He loves me! I knew it!

Ariel hugs the last orange flower petal. Sebastian joins her on the rock.

SEBASTIAN: Ariel, stop talking crazy.

ARIEL: I gotta see him again - tonight! Scuttle knows where he lives.

Ariel begins to swim away. Sebastian grabs onto her fins.

SEBASTIAN: Ariel - please. Will you get your head out of the clouds and back in the water where it belongs?

ARIEL: I'll swim up to his castle. Then Flounder will splash around to get his attention, and then with -

Sebastian gets in front of her face.

SEBASTIAN: Down here is your home!

"Under the Sea"
SEBASTIAN: Ariel - listen to me. The human world, it's a mess. Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there!

The seaweed is always greener

In somebody else's lake

You dream about going up there

But that is a big mistake

Just look at the world around you

Right here on the ocean floor

Such wonderful things around you

What more is you lookin' for?

Under the sea

Under the sea

Darling it's better

Down where it's wetter

Take it from me!

Up on the shore they work all day

Out in the sun they slave away

While we devoting

Full time to floating!

Under the sea!

Sebastion plays clams like steel pans along with a blue lobster who he duets with

Down here all the fish is happy

As off through the waves they roll, yeah

The fish on the land ain't happy

They sad 'cause they in the bowl

But fish in the bowl is lucky

They in for a worser fate

One day when the boss get hungry

Guess who's gonna be on the plate?

Oh, no!

Under the sea

Under the sea

Nobody beat us

Fry us and eat us

In fricassee

We what the land folks loves to cook

Under the sea we off the hook

We got no troubles

Life is the bubbles!

Under the sea (under the sea)

Under the sea (Under the sea)

Since life is sweet here

We got the beat here

Naturally (naturally-y-y-y)

Even the sturgeon and the ray

They get the urge and start to play

We got the spirit

You got to hear it

Under the sea!

The newt play the flute

The carp play the harp

The plaice play the bass

And they soundin' sharp

The bass play the brass

The chub play the tub

The fluke is the duke of soul

[Yeah]

The ray, he can play

The ling's on the strings

The trout's rocking out

The blackfish, she sings

The smelt and the sprat

They know where it's at

And oh, that blowfish blow!

Flounder weaves through the party of the animals getting down and whispers something to Ariel, prompting her to swim away unnoticed.

Yeah!

Under the sea! (Under the sea!)

Under the sea! (Under the sea! )

When the sardine

Begin the beguine

It's music to me! (Music it is to me!)

What do they got? A lot of sand

We got a hot crustacean band!

Each little clam here

Know how to jam here

Under the sea!

Each little slug here

Cutting a rug here

Under the sea!

Each little snail here

Know how to wail here

That's why it's hotter

Under the water

Ya we in luck here

Down in the muck here

Under the seeeeeeeeeaaaaaaa!

Everyone points to Ariel's empty place as the grand finale and turns away disappointed.

SEBASTIAN: Ariel? Ariel? Oh... somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor.

SEAHORSE: Sebastian! Sebastian, I've been looking all over for you. I've got an urgent message from the sea king.

SEBASTIAN: The sea king?

SEAHORSE: (tugging at Sebastian) He wants to see you right away - something about Ariel.

SEBASTIAN: (gasps) He knows!

"Sebastian & Triton"
CUT TO: INT. THRONE ROOM

King Triton holds the flower Ariel gave him, laughing.

TRITON: Let's see, now... Oh, who could the lucky merman be?

Triton notices Sebastian, who looks confused by his behavior. He coughs to compose himself and hides the flower.

TRITON: Come in, Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN: I mustn't overreact. I must remain calm.

Sebastian scampers down the path to the towering throne.

SEBASTIAN: (speaking five octaves higher than normal) Yes (clears throat, in normal voice) - yes, Your Majesty.

TRITON: Now, Sebastian, I'm concerned about Ariel. Have you noticed she's been acting peculiar lately?

SEBASTIAN: Peculiar?

TRITON: You know, moaning about, daydreaming, singing to herself... You haven't noticed, hmm?

SEBASTIAN: Oh - well, I -

TRITON: Sebastian...

SEBASTIAN: Hmmm?

TRITON: (beckoning Sebastian up) I know you've been keeping something from me...

Sebastian takes a gulp.

SEBASTIAN: Keeping... something?

TRITON: About Ariel?

Sebastian notices his legs are shaking and covers them.

SEBASTIAN: Ariel?

TRITON: (pointing his trident to a bewildered Sebastian) In love?

SEBASTIAN: (breaking down, grabbing onto Triton's beard) I TRIED TO STOP HER, SIR!!! She wouldn't listen! I told her to stay away from humans - they are bad, they are trouble, they-

TRITON: Humans? WHAT ABOUT HUMANS?!

SEBASTIAN: Humans? (laughingly) Who said anything about humans?

Triton grabs Sebastian and pulls him away.

"Destruction of A Grotto"
CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE OF GROTTO

Ariel and Flounder enter the grotto.

ARIEL: Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?

FLOUNDER: You'll see. It's a suprise.

ARIEL: (sees the statue of Eric in the middle of the cave) Oh, Flounder- Flounder you're the best! It looks just like him. It even has his eyes. (speaking to the statue) Why, Eric, run away with you? This is all so - so sudden...

Ariel laughs and twirls around. She gasps as she sees Triton angrily glaring in the entryway.

ARIEL: Daddy!

Flounder hides behind a chest.

TRITON: I consider myself a reasonable merman. I set certain rules, and I expect those rules to be followed.

ARIEL: But, Daddy!

TRITON: Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?

ARIEL: Daddy, I had -

TRITON: Contact between the human world and the mer-world is strictly forbidden. Ariel, you know that! Everyone knows that!

ARIEL: He would have died!

TRITON: One less human to worry about!

ARIEL: You don't even know him!

TRITON: Know him? I don't have to know him. They're all the same. Spineless, savage, harpooning, fish-eaters, incapable of any feeling-

ARIEL: (hiding behind the statue) Daddy, I love him!

Sebastian bites his claw. A dramatic chord strikes.

TRITON: (horrified) No... Have you lost your senses completely?! He's a human, you're a mermaid!

ARIEL: I don't care.

TRITON: So help me Ariel, I am going to get through to you! And if this is the only way, so be it!

King Triton's trident glows with lightning and the room is cast in an orange glow. Beams shoot from his trident and destroy Ariel's 1820s globe. Sebastian ducks as he destroys various artifacts in the grotto like Ariel's 1820s silverware stand, portrait, books, dancing music box, birdcage, treasure chest, harp and hourglass. Triton's eyes settle on the statue of Eric.

ARIEL: Daddy!... No,no... please- Daddy, stop! Daddy, No!

He blasts the statue, and it explodes into pieces. Ariel collapses on a rock and begins crying for breaking grotto. Flounder and Sebastian watch as he leaves, with his head bowed sadly.

SEBASTIAN: Ariel, I...

ARIEL: (still crying for broken grotto) Just go away.

Sebastian pouts and turns to leave. Flounder follows behind. The camera pans out to show the destroyed grotto. Flotsam and Jetsam peer out over a shelf.

FLOTSAM: Poor child.

JETSAM: Poor, sweet child.

FLOTSAM: She has a very serious problem

JETSAM: If only there were something we could do.

FLOTSAM: But there is something.

ARIEL: Who - who are you?

JETSAM: Don't be scared.

FLOTSAM: We represent someone who can help you.

JETSAM: Someone who could make all your dreams come true.

FLOTSAM & JETSAM: Just imagine -

JETSAM: You and your prince -

FLOTSAM & JETSAM: Together, forever...

ARIEL: I don't understand.

JETSAM: Ursula has great powers

Ariel gasps and places a hand to her heart.

ARIEL: The sea witch? (shaking her head) Why, that's - I couldn't possibly - no! Get out of here! Leave me alone!

FLOTSAM: Suit yourself.

JETSAM: It was only a suggestion.

Jetsam flicks the statue's broken face towards Ariel. She picks it up.

ARIEL: (looking at the face) Wait.

FLOTSAM & JETSAM: Yes?

"Poor Unfortunate Souls"
CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE GROTTO

FLOUNDER: (sniffling) Poor Ariel.

SEBASTIAN: I didn't mean to tell; it was an accident.

Ariel passes by with Flotsam and Jetsam. Alarmed, Sebastian swims up.

SEBASTIAN: Ariel - where are you going? Ariel, what are you doing here with this riffraff?

ARIEL: (determinedly) I'm going to see Ursula.

Sebastian gasps and grabs onto Ariel's fins.

SEBASTIAN: Ariel, no! No, she's a demon, she's a monster!

ARIEL: (looking back at Sebastian) Why don't you go tell my father? You're good at that.

Ariel shakes Sebastian off.

SEBASTIAN: But... But, I...

(to Flounder) Come on.

Sebastian and Flounder follow them.

CUT TO: OUTSIDE URSULA'S LAIR

Ariel and the eels swim towards Ursula's lair, which is shaped like a sea monster. An eerie purple light glows from inside. There's a purple & pink smoke around them. As they swim towards the mouth, Ariel stops.

FLOTAM & JETSAM: This way.

They enter through the mouth and pass by the garden of polyps. Ariel looks at them disgustedly. One grabs her arm, but Ariel pulls herself free.

Ursula's voice is heard from her conch shell rest.

URSULA: Come in. Come in, my child. We mustn't lurk in doorways - it's rude.

Ursula comes down and sits at a vanity.

URSULA: One might question your upbringing... Now, then. You're here because you have a thing for this human. This, er, prince fellow. Not that I blame you - he is quite a catch, isn't he? Well, angel fish, the solution to your problem is simple.

Ursula puts on bright red lipstick and puckers her lips.

URSULA: The only way to get what you want - is to become a human yourself.

ARIEL: Can you do that?

URSULA: My dear, sweet child. That's what I do - it's what I live for. To help unfortunate merfolk - like yourself. Poor souls with no one else to turn to.

(Singing) I admit that in the past I've been a nasty

They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch

But you'll find that nowadays

I've mended all my ways

Repented, seen the light and made a switch

True? Yes, And I fortunately know a little magic

It's a talent that I always have possessed

And here lately, please don't laugh (In the pink smoke for the honeymoon of Ariel & Eric)

I use it on behalf

Of the miserable, lonely and depressed

[Pathetic]

Poor unfortunate souls

In pain

In need

This one longing to be thinner

That one wants to get the girl

And do I help them?

Yes, indeed

Those poor unfortunate souls

So sad

So true

They come flocking to my cauldron

Crying, "Spells, Ursula please!"

And I help them?

Yes, I do

Now it's happened once or twice

Someone couldn't pay the price

And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals

Yes, I've had the odd complaint

But on the whole, I've been a saint

To those poor unfortunate souls

URSULA: (grabbing Ariel) Now, here's the deal. I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days. Got that? (motioning with her fingers) Three days. Now listen, this is important. Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear ol' princey to fall in love with you. That is, he's got to kiss you. Not just any kiss - the kiss of true love. (There's a purple smoke above the heart) If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you'll remain human, permanently, but - if he doesn't, you turn back into a mermaid, and - you belong to me!

SEBASTIAN: No, Ariel!

Flotsam and Jetsam wrap around Flounder and Sebastian to shut them up.

URSULA: (grabbing Ariel's face) Have we got a deal?

ARIEL: If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again.

URSULA: That's right... But - you'll have your man. Life's full of tough choices, innit? Oh - and there is one more thing. We haven't discussed the subject of payment. You can't get something for nothing, you know.

ARIEL: But I don't have any -

Ursula uses a tentacle for Ariel to be quiet.

URSULA: I'm not asking much. Just a token, really, a trifle. You'll never even miss it. What I want from you is... your voice.

ARIEL: (touching her throat) My voice?

URSULA: You've got it, sweetcakes. No more talking, singing, zip.

ARIEL: But without my voice, how can I -

URSULA: You'll have your looks! Your pretty face! And don't underestimate the importance of BODY LANGUAGE! Ha!

Ursula shakes her hips and resumes singing.

"Poor Unfortunate Souls" CONT.
URSULA: (Singing) The men up there don't like a lot of blabber

They think a girl who gossips is a bore

Yes, on land it's much preferred

For ladies not to say a word

And after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?

Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation

True gentlemen avoid it when they can (Ursula exploded for the bottles with a poof of purple/blue smoke)

But they dote and swoon and fawn

On a lady who's withdrawn

It's she who holds her tongue who gets her man

Come on, you poor unfortunate soul (She still exploded with a poof of purple/pink smoke inside the cauldron and it's Ariel's husband, Eric)

Go ahead!

Make your choice!

I'm a very busy woman

And I haven't got all day (It's Eric)

It won't cost much

Just your voice!

You poor unfortunate soul (She continues to explode with a poof of purple/blue smoke inside the cauldron)

It's sad

But true

If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet

You've got to pay the toll

Take a gulp and take a breath

And go ahead and sign the scroll!

Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys

The boss is on a roll

This poor unfortunate soul.

Ursula mixes her potion and pulls out a golden contract and quill in the shape of a fish's skeleton. Flounder and Sebastian gape as Ariel signs the contract.

URSULA: (Singing) Beluga, sevruga, come winds of the Caspian Sea. (There's a purple/pink smoke)

Amnesia, glossitis Et max laryngitis,

La voce to me!

Ursula begins casting her spell to take Ariel's voice. A giant, ghastly pair of creepy green hands appear beside Ursula, who is cast in green light.

URSULA: Now... sing!

Ariel vocalizes.

URSULA: Keep singing!

A glowing green current whips around Ariel as her voice glows within her. The hands rip out Ariel's voice and it floats into Ursula's shell necklace, who laughs evilly.

A poof of purple/yellow smoke rises from the cauldron and a bubble forms around Ariel. A whipping gold current rushes around her and her tail splits into two legs. She hurriedly tries to swim and is rushed to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian.

Ariel springs into the air to get a breath of air. She puts her arms around Sebastian and Flounder and they swim her to the shore.

"She's Got Legs, You Idiot"
CUT TO: EXT. SHORE

Eric leans his back on his seaside castle is in sight and plays the flute. max is beside him.

ERIC: That voice. I can't get it out of my head. I've looked everywhere, Max - where could she be?

In a cove further along the shoreline, Ariel lays on a rock. Sebastian and Flounder pant, exhausted. Ariel pushes her hair out of her face and sits up. She sees her legs and is amazed. She lifts her foot in the air and wiggles her toes.

SCUTTLE: Well, look at what the catfish dragged in!

Scuttle lands on her leg.

SCUTTLE: Look at ya! Look at ya! There's something different. Don't tell me - I got it. It's your hairdo, right? You've been using the dinglehopper, right?

Ariel shakes her head.

SCUTTLE: No? No huh, well let me see. New... seashells?

Ariel shakes the leg Scuttle is perching on to give him a clue.

SCUTTLE: No new seashells. I gotta admit I can't put my foot on it right now, but if I just stand here long enough I know that I'll -

SEBASTIAN: (shouting) She's got legs, you idiot! She traded her voice to the sea witch and got legs! Jeez, man...

SCUTTLE: I knew that.

FLOUNDER: Ariel's been turned into a human. She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he's gotta ki- he's gotta kiss her.

Ariel's legs wobble as she tries to stand up.

SEBASTIAN: And she's only got three days.

Ariel falls over, splashing her friends with seaweed.

SEBASTIAN: Just look at her. On legs. On human legs! My nerves are shot. This is a catastrophe! What would her father say? I'll tell you what her father'd say. (grabbing Flounder's face. Ariel puts seaweed away.) He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab, that's what her father'd say! (marching away) I'm gonna march me-self straight home right now and tell him just like I shoulda done de minute-

Ariel picks up Sebastian and holds him in his hands. He wags his claw at her as she shakes her head.

SEBASTIAN: And don't you shake your head at me, young lady. Maybe there's still time. If we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with all the normal fish, and just be... just be...

Ariel frowns sadly.

SEBASTIAN: Just be miserable for the rest of your life. (shakes his head) All right, all right. I'll try to help you find that prince.

Ariel smiles and kisses Sebastian's head. She sets him down.

SEBASTIAN: Boy. What a soft-shell I'm turning out to be.

Scuttle lands beside a wreckage and picks up a sail.

SCUTTLE: Now, Ariel, I'm tellin' ya, if you wanna be a human the first thing you gotta do is dress like one. Now lemme see.

Scuttle picks up a rope.

"On Land"
CUT TO: EXT. SHORE

Eric walks along the shore with Max. He sniffs and raises his brow. He barks and hops around excitedly. He runs down the beach.

ERIC: Max? Huh... what, Max!

Eric follows Max. Scuttle whistles.

SCUTTLE: Ya look great kid. Ya look - sensational.

Ariel wears the sail tied with ropes. She's alarmed by Max's barking. Flounder splashes back into the sea and Sebastian skitters away hopping into a pocket in the sail. Ariel climbs onto a rock and Max licks her face.

ERIC: Max... Max - Quiet Max!

Max tugs at Eric's leg.

ERIC: What's gotten into you fella? (seeing Ariel) Oh... Oh, I see. Are you O.K., miss? I'm sorry if this knucklehead scared you. He's harmless, really -

Eric gazes at her face and points at her.

ERIC: You... seem very familiar... to me. Have we met?

Ariel nods.

ERIC: We have met?

Max comes between them and barks.

ERIC: I knew it! (grabbing Ariel's hands) You're the one - the one I've been looking for! What's your name?

Ariel opens her mouth to reply "Ariel" and nothing comes out. She touches her throat, disappointed.

ERIC: What's wrong? What is it?

Ariel taps her throat.

ERIC: You can't speak?

Ariel shakes her head.

ERIC: Oh, oh. Then you couldn't be who I thought.

Ariel and Max let out frustrated sighs. Ariel waves her arms in an attempt to pantomine.

ERIC: What is it? You're hurt? No, No... You need help.

Ariel falls into his arms. Eric holds her, helping her stand.

ERIC: Whoa, whoa, careful - careful - easy. Gee, you must have really been through something. Don't worry, I'll help you. Come on... Come on, you'll be okay.

Eric leads her away. Scuttle gives a thumbs up and Flounder grins.

CUT TO: INT. 1820s CASTLE BATHROOM

In a magnificent bathroom, Ariel sits in a water tub of bubbles in the 1820s bathtub.

CARLOTTA: Washed up from a shipwreck. Oh, the poor thing. We'll have you feeling better in no time.

Carlotta splashes a bucket of water on top of her head. Sebastian peeks out from where he's been hiding in Ariel's makeshift dress. Carlotta picks it up, grimacing.

CARLOTTA: I'll just... I'll just get this washed for you.

CUT TO: EXT. 1820s WASHING AREA

Sebastian sits in a tub of soapy water as women surround it and wash in the laundry room in the 1820s laundry tub.

GERTRUDE: Well you must have at least heard about this girl.

WOMAN 2: No!

GERTRUDE: Well, Gertrude says-

The woman rungs the dress down a washboard and Sebastian is pulled along with it.

GERTRUDE: Since when has Gertrude got anything right? (Sebastian burps out some bubbles) I mean, really.

Sebastian is pulled through a wringer with the dress that has become a shirt.

SEBASTIAN: Madam, please...

GERTRUDE: This girl shows up in rags and doesn't speak. Not my idea of a princess. If Eric's looking for a girl, I know a couple of highly available ones right here...

Sebastian crawls into the pocket of the shirt that is hung to dry. As the shirt slides past a window, he falls in headfirst. His eyes bug out as he sees a dead fish on a chopping board, boiling pots and a frying pan of sea creatures, and a platter of stuffed crabs. He faints.

"Ariel at the Palace"
CUT TO: 1820s DINING ROOM

Grimsby sits at the head of the table as Eric gazes out the windows, which stretch from floor to ceiling, at the ocean.

GRIMSBY: Oh, Eric, be reasonable. Nice young ladies just don't - swim around rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then - flutter off into oblivion, like some -

ERIC: I'm tellin' you, Grim, she was real! I'm gonna find that girl - and I'm gonna marry her.

CARLOTTA: Ha Ha. Come on honey. Don't be shy.

Carlotta and Ariel come through the entrance. Ariel wears a long sleeve pink/white gown with pink high heels on.

GRIMSBY: Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?

ERIC: Uh - you look wonderful.

GRIMSBY: (taking Ariel) Come come come, you must be famished. Let me help you my dear.

Grimsby and Eric settle Ariel into a chair.

GRIMSBY: There we go - ah - quite comfy? Uh. It's - It's not often that we have such a lovely dinner guest, eh Eric?

Ariel sees a dinglehopper fork on the table and picks it up, combing her hair. Eric holds a goblet and raises an eyebrow. Grimsby looks perplexed. She puts it down, embarrassed.

Grimsby lights up his pipe and sees Ariel smiling at it. He hands it to her.

GRIMSBY: Uh, do you like it? It is rather - fine...

She blows into it, covering Grimsby's face in ashes with a snarfblatt pipe. Eric laughs.

CARLOTTA: Oh, my!

ERIC: Ahem, so sorry Grim.

CARLOTTA: Why, Eric, that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks.

Ariel smiles at this. Grimsby wipes his face.

GRIMSBY: Oh, very amusing. Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?

CARLOTTA: Ooh, you're gonna love it. Chef's been fixing his specialty, stuffed crab.

CUT TO: INT. 1820s KITCHEN

Sebastian sees Chef Louis, who takes out a bowl of dead fish. He sings to himself as he cooks.

"Les Possions"
CHEF LOUIS: (Singing) Les poissons

Les poissons

How I love les poissons

Love to chop

And to serve little fish

First I cut off their heads

Then I pull out the bones

Ah mais oui

Ca c'est toujours delish

Les poissons

Les poissons

Hee hee hee

Hah hah hah

With the cleaver I hack them in two

I pull out what's inside

And I serve it up fried

God, I love little fishes

Don't you?

Here's something for tempting the palate

Prepared in the classic technique

First you pound the fish flat with a mallet

Then you slash through the skin

Give the belly a slice

Then you rub some salt in

'Cause that makes it taste nice

Sebastian quivers and hides as Louis brutalizes the sea creatures. A fish's head lands in front of a mortified Sebastian. He hides under a leaf of lettuce to escape, but as Louis clangs down on the table with a cleaver, Sebastian is jolted into the air. Louis raises the leaf and sees Sebastian.

LOUIS: Zut alors, I have missed one!

"Les Possions" CONT.
CHEF LUIS: (Singing) Sacre bleu

What is this?

How on earth could I miss

Such a sweet little succulent crab?

Quel dommage

What a loss

Here we go in the sauce

Now some flour, I think

Just a dab

Now I stuff you with bread

It don't hurt 'cause you're dead

And you're certainly lucky you are

'Cause it's gonna be hot

In my big silver pot

Toodle loo mon poisson

Au revoir!

Louis picks up Sebastian. He throws him in a sauce bowl with Polynesian sauce and throws flour on him. Sebastian sneezes with flour. Louis stuffs Sebastian's shells with lettuce and bread. he spits it out with coughing gag.

Louis throws Sebastian across the room to the giant silver pot. Sebastian narrowly misses the boiling water and jumps out. The chef turns around to see Sebastian on the counter. He picks him up.

LOUIS: What is this?

Sebastian pinches his nose and Sebastian flies away, landing on the handle of a saucepan. Louis tries to grab him again and his hand goes on the stove. Yowling, he reels back in pain. A pan lands on his foot and he hops about.

He grabs knives from a knife block and throws them towards Sebastian, who scampers through a small hole in the cabinet. On the counter he drops a bowl with Polynesian sauce onto Louis' head. He runs under the cabinet again as the chef lifts an enormous knife and chops it in half.

Sebastian dashes across the floor as a knife lands in front of him. He runs between Louis' legs towards a cabinet with dishes. Louis jumps to the cabinet with a hammer.

CUT TO: INT. DINING ROOM

Crashing noises are heard.

CARLOTTA: I think I'd better go see what Louis is up to.

CUT TO: INT. KITCHEN

The kitchen is in total disarray as Louis digs around looking for Sebastian.

LOUIS: Come out you little pipsqueak and fight like a man!

CARLOTTA: Louis!

Louis bangs his head. Carlotta puts her hands on her hips.

CARLOTTA: What are you doing?

LOUIS: Well - I - I was just - er, er, I'm sorry, madame.

Carlotta carries out the tray of the dinner plates with a huff.

"Dinner Time"
CUT TO: INT. DINING ROOM

GRIMSBY: You know, Eric, perhaps our young guest might enjoy seeing some of the sights of the kingdom. Something in the way of a tour?

Carlotta sets their plates down. Eric gazes at Ariel, head in hand.

ERIC: I'm sorry, Grim, what was that?

GRIMSBY: You can't spend all your time moping about, you need to get out. Do something, have a life.

Grimsby lifts his plate's cover to reveal Sebastian cowering in the salad with a side of cottage cheese. He motions "shh."

GRIMSBY: Get your mind off -

Ariel beckons him to hide in her plate.

ERIC: Easy, Grim, easy. It's not a bad idea, if she's interested.

Sebastian runs to Ariel's plate and she covers it, leaning heavily on her plate's cover, splattered with cottage cheese when Eric looks at her.

ERIC: Well - whaddaya say? Would you like to join me on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?

Ariel nods vigorously.

GRIMSBY: Wonderful, now let's eat, before this crab wanders off my plate.

He stabs his fork in an empty plate and becomes confused to see that his 'crab' is really gone.

"Ariel's Bedtime"
CUT TO: EXT. ERIC'S CASTLE

Ariel leans on her balcony, wearing a pink long sleeve nightgown. She watches as Eric plays with Max on the lawn.

ERIC: Come here, boy! Arrr...

Max licks Eric's face and Eric ruffles his fur. Ariel smiles. Eric sees her and waves. She waves back shyly and enters her room. Eric smiles at her.

CUT TO: INT. ARIEL'S ROOM

Ariel brushes her hair with a dinglehopper fork and Sebastian sits on a table.

SEBASTIAN: This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day of my life.

Sebastian takes a lettuce leaf from the kitchen off his head. Ariel passes him and pats his head.

SEBASTIAN: I hope you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady.

Ariel sinks into her bed.

SEBASTIAN: Now - we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you. Tomorrow, when he takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best. You gotta bat your eyes - like this. You gotta pucker up your lips - like this.

Sebastian demonstrates to Ariel. He sees Ariel has fallen asleep. Smiling, he blows out a candle on the nightstand and hops onto the pillow beside her.

SEBASTIAN: Hm. You are hopeless, child. You know dat? Completely hopeless...

CUT TO: EXT. TRITON'S PALACE

The seahorse swims hurriedly to the throne room, where King Triton swims back and forth with his hands behind his back.

TRITON: Any sign of them?

SEAHORSE: No, Your Majesty. We've searched everywhere. We've found no trace of your daughter - or Sebastian.

TRITON: Well, keep looking. Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored. Let no one in this kingdom sleep until she's safe at home.

SEAHORSE: Yes, sire.

The seahorse bows and leaves. Triton sits in his throne.

TRITON: Oh, what have I done? What have I done?

"Tour of the Kingdom"
CUT TO: EXT. ERIC'S CASTLE

The sun rises on June 30, 1824. Carlotta and Grimsby wave goodbye to Eric and Ariel as they ride away in a 1820s horse-drawn buggy. They take a road leading to town and Ariel points at something excitedly. Eric smiles at her, but then looks at her leaning over the side of the buggy in confusion. She is watching the ground and the horse's feet clopping.

As they pass over a canal, Flounder leaps through the water. Sebastian peers out over the buggy.

FLOUNDER: Has he kissed her yet?

SEBASTIAN: Not yet.

FLOUNDER: Ohh.

CUT TO: EXT. TOWN

In the bustling town square, Ariel watches a man push a cart of clucking chickens and sheep. Two puppets perform on a small stage. Ariel pulls one off, revealing the puppeteer's hand. She pulls Eric's hand to the dance area. He twirls her and lifts her into the air.

CUT TO: EXT. CANALS

Scuttle flies overhead as Flounder swims in the canal.

SCUTTLE: Yo, Flounder! Any kissing?

FLOUNDER: No, not yet.

SCUTTLE: Hmm. Well they - they better get crackin'.

In the buggy, Eric and Ariel ride out of town. Ariel wears a hat and holds bread, a bouquet of flowers, and a pair of boots. Eric offers Ariel the reins. She eagerly snaps them and the buggy races forward as she grins. Eric gapes, seeing a wide gulley ahead. Ariel speeds and they soar across to the other side, he knocked down the bread, flowers and a boots and Eric snapped the branches with leaves. The horse jumps over the gulley and lands on the other side. It continues trotting while Ariel keeps holding the reins to drive the buggy. Eric peeks up from the bottom of the buggy after he has fallen down and sees that they are safe. He sits back down, impressed by Ariel's horse-riding skills. As they ride off into the countryside, Eric relaxes, folding his hands behind his head.

"Kiss The Girl"
CUT TO: EXT. LAGOON

Eric rows himself and Ariel out on the lagoon on July 1, 1824.

FLOUNDER: Move over - move your big feathers. I can't see a thing.

SCUTTLE: Nothing is happening... Only one day left, and that boy ain't puckered up once. O.K. All right, this calls for a little vocal romantic stimulation. Stand back.

Scuttle lands on a branch and signs horribly.

ERIC: Wow. Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.

Ariel grimaces as Scuttle signals "A OK." She facepalms. Sebastian covers his ears.

SEBASTIAN: Jeez, man, I'm surrounded by amateurs!

He dives down into the water and picks a reed.

SEBASTIAN: You want something done, you've got to do it yourself. First, we got to create the mood.

Ducks appear and turtles turn over on their backs.

SEBASTIAN: Percussion...

The ducks tap the turtle's bellies as if they were drums.

SEBASTIAN: Strings...

Sebastian conducts crickets, who rub their legs together, sounding like a string section

SEBASTIAN: Winds...

The wind blows through the reeds.

SEBASTIAN: Words.

Sebastian holds a cat tail as if it was a microphone. He sings in Eric's ear.

SEBASTIAN: (Singing) There you see her

Sitting there across the way

She don't got a lot to say

But there's something about her

And you don't know why

But you're dying to try

You wanna kiss the girl

ERIC: (turning to look back) Did you hear something?

Ariel shrugs.

CONT. "Kiss the Girl"
SEBASTIAN: (Singing) Yes, you want her

Look at her, you know you do

Possible she wants you too

There is one way to ask her

It don't take a word

Not a single word

Go on and kiss the girl (Sing with me now)

Sha la la la la la

My oh my

Look like the boy too shy

Ain't gonna kiss the girl

Sha la la la la la

Ain't that sad?

Ain't it a shame?

Too bad, he gonna miss the girl

ERIC: You know, I feel really bad not knowing your name. Heh - maybe I could guess. Is it, uh, Mildred?

Ariel sticks out her tongue.

ERIC: O.K., no. How 'bout - Diana?

Ariel shakes her head.

ERIC: Rachel?

SEBASTIAN: (whispering) Ariel. Her name is Ariel.

Eric looks back, confused has right name is Ariel.

ERIC: Ariel?

Ariel nods enthusiastically.

ERIC: Ariel?

Ariel takes his hand.

ERIC: Well, that's kinda pretty. O.K. - Ariel...

CONT. "Kiss the Girl"
Sebastian and the lagoon creatures continue serenading them as they float along. Two pelicans pull back the leaves of a willow tree as Eric and Ariel pass through.

SEBASTIAN: Now's your moment Floating in a blue lagoon Boy you better do it soon No time will be better

She don't say a word

And she won't say a word

The music play

You got to kiss the girl

You've got to kiss the girl

You wanna kiss the girl

You've gotta kiss the girl

Go on and kiss the girl

Fish circle under the boat, turning it slowly. Fireflies surround the boat. As Scuttle begins to sing, flamingos shut him up. Fish, including Flounder, surround the boat and spurt water from their lips, creating a fountain effect. The animals whisper to kiss Ariel.

Eric leans in and gazes into her eyes. Ariel closes her eyes and puckers her lips in anticipation. Eric closes his eyes as well and their lips nearly touch before they are knocked off the rowboat, which flips by Flotsam & Jetsam.

Sebastian hits his head and Scuttle looks mortified.

ERIC: Whoa, hang on - I've gotcha.

The lagoon creatures skitter away as Flotsam and Jetsam rise and slap their tails in the style of a high-five and snicker.

"Ariel Left Behind"
CUT TO: URSULA'S LAIR

Ursula watches Ariel and Eric through a bubble.

URSULA: Nice work, boys. That was a close one. Too close. The little tramp! Oh, she's better than I thought. At this rate, he'll be kissing her by sunset for sure.

Ursula swims to her shelf of ingredients and smashes them aside, picking up some ingredients.

URSULA: Well, it's time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles!

Ursula smashes ingredients into the cauldron, sending puffs of purple/pink smoke in the water.

URSULA: Triton's daughter will be mine - and then I'll make him writhe. I'll see him wriggle like a worm on a hook!

Laughing, she clutches her shell necklace. A golden emanates from behind her. Ursula transforms into a human and her voice becomes Ariel's, it was Vanessa.

CUT TO: EXT. ERIC'S CASTLE

The moon shines bright. On a terrace, Eric plays the melody of "Part of Your World (Reprise)" on his flute. He gazes out to the sea, contemplating as Grimsby approaches.

GRIMSBY: Eric, if I may say, far better than any dream girl, is one of flesh and blood, one warm and caring, and right before your eyes. (walking backwards to leave and gesturing to something above him)

Eric glances up at a window where Ariel stands in her pink nightgown, combing her hair with the fork she used before. She looks up with a smile and leaves for bed. Eric smiles towards her. He looks sadly at his flute. Gazing firmly at it, he takes a step back and throws it out to the water. He looks towards Ariel's window and begins to stride towards it, but then stops when he hears her voice vocalizing "Ahhh."

He goes back to the edge of the terrace and leans over to see a woman walking along the shore, the sea witch in disguise singing with Ariel's voice. Eric strains to see her clearly. The shell necklace hangs around her neck, glowing brightly. An eerie golden mist winds through the air towards Eric. It enters his eyes, enchanting him with a spell that hypnotizes him.

CUT TO: EXT. ERIC'S CASTLE

Scuttle swoops over the castle, flying to Ariel's window.

SCUTTLE: Ariel! Ariel, wake up! Wake up! I just heard the news. Congratulations, kiddo, we did it!

Scuttle shakes Ariel's hand as she sits up, still half-asleep. Sebastian yawns and tries to go back to sleep.

SEBASTIAN: What is this idiot babbling about?

SCUTTLE: Right - as if you two didn't know, uh? The whole town's buzzin' about the prince gettin' himself hitched this afternoon! You know, he's getting married!

Scuttle picks up Sebastian and rubs his head.

SCUTTLE: You silly sidewalker! (to Ariel) I just wanted to wish you luck. I'll catch you later, I wouldn't miss it!

Scuttle flies out the window. Ariel's eyes grow wide. Leaping out of bed, she scoops up Sebastian, twirls him around and gives him a kiss on the head. She fluffs her hair and rushes out the room. Sebastian gets out of bed and follows her. She runs down the stairs and stops, flabbergasted to see Eric and Vanessa with Grimsby.

GRIMSBY: Well, uh - err, Eric. I-it appears that I was mistaken.

Ariel hides behind a beam and listens on. Sebastian joins her.

GRIMSBY: This mystery maiden of yours does - in fact exist. And - and she is lovely. (holding Vanessa's hand) Congratulations, my dear.

ERIC: We wish to be married as soon as possible.

Ariel looks shocked and shakes her head with a silent 'no'.

GRIMSBY: Oh, yes - of course, Eric, but, er - but these things do take time, you know...

Sebastian is also shocked and looks up at Ariel, who quickly hides herself back to behind the beam.

ERIC: This afternoon, Grimsby. The wedding ship departs at sunset.

GRIMSBY: Oh, oh - very well, Eric - as you wish.

Ariel is distraught and runs off crying. Vanessa sees her as Eric stands stiffly, under the trance of the spell. She holds her necklace and snickers. The necklace glows.

CUT TO: EXT. ERIC'S PALACE

The wedding boat departs from the dock. Ariel stands at the docks watching. She sighs and sinks to the dock, burying her head in tears. Sebastian looks up at her and sadly bows his head. A tear rolls down Ariel's cheek and falls to the water. Nearby, Flounder cries too.

Over the ship, Scuttle swoops down over the sky.

"Poor Unfortunate Souls (Reprise)/The Sun Sets On A Third Day"
Scuttle peeks through a porthole to see Vanessa singing to herself. She takes a hairpin off her hair and throws it at the angel figure's temple on her mirror. Scuttle gulps, realizing the bride is not Ariel. Vanessa steps onto her vanity, crushing a bottle. She twirls around and pulls the mirror towards her, laughing at her reflection evilly.

VANESSA: (Singing) What a lovely little bride

I'll make, my dear I'll look divine

Things are working out according to my ultimate design

Soon I'll have that little mermaid and the ocean will be mine!

Scuttle sees her reflection is that of Ursula.

SCUTTLE: The sea witch! Oh no... She's- I gotta...

In a rush to leave, he bumps his head on the porthole. He flies back to Ariel.

SCUTTLE: Ariel! Ariel!

Ariel. I was flying, I wa - of course I was flying - An' - I s- I saw that the watch - the witch was watchin' a mirror, and she was singin' with a stolen set o' pipes!

Scuttle picks up Sebastian and clanks him against the dock repeatedly.

SCUTTLE: (yelling) Do you hear what I'm tellin' you? The prince is marrying the sea witch in disguise!

Ariel drops her jaw in shock.

SEBASTIAN: (rubbing his head) Are you sure about this?

SCUTTLE: Have I ever been wrong?! I mean when it's important!

FLOUNDER: What are we gonna do!?

Ariel runs to the edge of the dock. She looks to the setting sun and hears Ursula's voice in her head.

URSULA: Before the sun sets on the third day...

Ariel leaps into the water. She surfaces and splashes around helplessly. Sebastian looks around and sees some barrels tied to a rope. He cuts them free for Ariel to hang onto one.

SEBASTIAN: Ariel, grab on to that. Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as your fins can carry you.

FLOUNDER: I'll try.

Flounder loops himself into the rope and pulls Ariel along to the boat.

SEBASTIAN: I've gotta get to the sea king. He must know about this.

SCUTTLE: What - What about me? What about me?

SEBASTIAN: You - find a way to stall that wedding! (jumping into the water)

SCUTTLE: Stall the wedding. Wh- what am I - what - that's it!

Scuttle squawks and takes off for the lagoon, alerting the other animals. Bluebirds and flamingos follow him. Starfish, lobsters, dolphins, and sea lions look up. The animals follow Scuttle.

SCUTTLE: Move it, let's go, we got an emergency here!

"Crash The Wedding"
CUT TO: EXT. DECK OF ERIC'S BOAT

Vanessa and Eric walk down the aisle. Max snarls at her as she passes by and she kicks him on the heel to make him stop. A short bishop stands at the end of the aisle.

BISHOP: Dearly beloved...

CUT TO: OCEAN

Flounder struggles to pull Ariel some more.

FLOUNDER: Don't worry Ariel. Ugh - we - we're gonna make it. We're almost there.

CUT TO: EXT. DECK OF ERIC'S BOAT

BISHOP: Yes, um, do you Eric, take Vanessa, to be your lawfully wedded wife, for as long as you both shall live?

Vanessa looks at the sun, noticing it's almost set.

ERIC: I do.

Scuttle squawks.

BISHOP: Eh, and do you...

A squadron of bluebirds swoop down from the sky led by Scuttle aimed directly towards Vanessa, who ducks down in time. She looks back up and becomes surprised to see them flying back straight to her. They fly under her white dress. Max barks. Guests are alarmed by the birds in the air as two sea lions jump on deck. Three pelicans fly overhead and dump beaks full of water on Vanessa. A lobster pinches her nose and a bunch of starfish smother her and her white wedding gown.

BISHOP: (oblivious to the commotion) then by the power inves-

VANESSA: Get away from me, you slimy little-

A sea lion tosses her in the air on his nose.

Ariel arrives and climbs up the ship.

The sea lions toss Vanessa into the wedding cake, 1820s glasses and 1820s plates breaking. Ariel reaches to the railing and sees the commotion. Vanessa pops out of the smashed wedding cake and growling because I'm furious, and three dolphins squirt water at her. Scuttle flies to her and squawks loudly into her face.

VANESSA: Oh, why you little-

Vanessa wrings Scuttle's neck. Max breaks free from his leash. Scuttle struggles to get Vanessa's necklace off her neck with his beak while she pulls him away from her. Max runs to Vanessa from behind and bites her in the rear. Scuttle manages to break the necklace off her neck, which goes flying through the air.

The necklace breaks near Ariel and her voice floats. The spell on Eric wears off. He grabs his head and sees where he is hearing Ariel's voice singing. Grimsby and the guests watch in shock. Vanessa watches angrily. Ariel's voice floats back to her throat and is restored back to her, revealing herself as the girl who rescued Eric.

"Final Battle"
"Ursula Defeats"
ERIC: Ariel?

ARIEL: Eric.

Max barks happily at her.

ERIC: You - you can talk. You're the one.

Eric runs to her and grasps her hands.

VANESSA: (now in Ursula's own voice) Eric, get away from her!

Vanessa covers her mouth.

ERIC: It - it was you all the time.

ARIEL: Oh, Eric, I - I wanted to tell you.

VANESSA: Eric, no!

The sun sets as Eric and Ariel are about to kiss. Ariel feels her legs turning back into her mermaid tail.

VANESSA: (cackling) You're too late! You're too late!

Vanessa rips out of her white dress and turns back into Ursula. The crowd gasps in shock. Ursula slithers across the deck and grabs Ariel.

URSULA: So long, loverboy.

She jumps over the edge of the ship into the ocean with Ariel as her prisoner.

ERIC: Ariel!

URSULA: Poor little princess - it's not you I'm after. I've a much bigger fish to -

TRITON: Ursula, stop!

Triton points his glowing trident at Ursula. Sebastian glares at her with a "hmph."

URSULA: Why, King Triton. Ha ha ha - How are you?

Triton angrily points his glowing trident at Ursula.

TRITON: Let her go!

Ursula angrily gives Triton the attitude and has Ariel to herself.

URSULA: Not a chance, Triton! She's mine now. We made a deal.

Ursula shows Triton the glowing scroll as Flotsam and Jetsam restrain Ariel.

ARIEL: Daddy, I'm sorry! I - I - I didn't mean to. I didn't know -

Triton zaps a beam at Ursula and the contract, which remain unharmed.

URSULA: You see? The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable - even for you. Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain. The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.

The contract is released by Ursula and its golden light swirls around Ariel.

TRITON: Ariel—-

URSULA: But - I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better...

Ursula touches her tentacle to Triton's crown.

CUT TO: EXT. ERIC'S BOAT

Eric rows a small boat out to the sea.

GRIMSBY: Eric! What are you doing?

ERIC: Grim, I lost her once. I'm not going to lose her again.

CUT TO: UNDER THE WATER

Ariel becomes increasingly small and shriveled to resemble the polyps in Ursula's garden. She holds out the contract.

URSULA: Now! Do we have a deal?

Triton looks away and signs over Ariel's signature using his trident.

URSULA: Ha! It's done then.

The magical golden current holding Ariel releases her with her real self back to normal and takes over Triton, turning him into another one of Ursula's polyps.

ARIEL: No... Oh, no!

Ursula cackles.

CUT TO: ABOVE WATER

Eric stands in his rowboat, harpoon in hand.

CUT TO: UNDER WATER

Only Triton's crown and trident remain. He shows himself around his crown as a polyp.

SEBASTIAN: Your Majesty...

ARIEL: Daddy?

URSULA: At last...

Ursula picks up the crown and puts it on.

ARIEL: No.

URSULA: It's mine.

She holds the trident and cackles to herself. Ariel angrily springs at her.

ARIEL: You - You monster!

Ursula throws Ariel down and points the trident at her.

URSULA: Don't fool with me, you little brat! Contract or no, I'll blast—-Ow!

Eric's harpoon grazes Ursula's arm. He watches under water.

URSULA: Why, you little fool.

ARIEL: Eric! Eric look out!

URSULA: (to Flotsam and Jetsam) After him!

Flotsam and Jetsam chase Eric as he swims back to the surface. He reaches his boat, but they pull him back under water.

SEBASTIAN: Come on!

Flounder and Sebastian attack Flotsam and Jetsam. Sebastian pinches one eel's tail while Flounder flaps his fins in the other's face.

URSULA: Say goodbye to your sweetheart.

Ursula aims the trident at Eric, but Ariel yanks her hair, causing the beam of lightning to hit Flotsam and Jetsam, who burn to crisps with eel bones to the fragrance of hickory smoked Flotsam & Jetsam's bones.

URSULA: Babies! My poor, little poopsies!

Ursula holds their remains and her eyes go wild. Seeing Ariel escaping, Ursula begins grow, huff, and release a black cloud of ink. Flounder and Sebastian cower.

CUT TO: ABOVE WATER

ARIEL: Eric, you've got to get away from here.

ERIC: No, I won't leave you.

A spike on Triton's crown comes between Eric and Ariel as a gigantic Ursula rises from the water, laughing manically.

Eric and Ariel jump into the water and clutch each other, looking up to see Ursula towering over them.

URSULA: You pitiful, insignificant, fool!

ERIC: (pointing) Look out!

One of Ursula's tentacles crashes down into the water.

URSULA: Now I am the ruler of all the ocean! The waves obey my every whim!

Ursula raises the trident and swirls it, creating a storm with lightning. A wave sweeps Eric away.

ARIEL: Eric!

URSULA: The sea and all its spoils bow to my power!

She swirls the trident in the water, creating a whirlpool. The spinning funnel reaches the ocean floor, churning up sunken ships. Ariel dodges the wreckage. One of the ships veers towards Eric and he tries to swim away, but he is shoved under water.

ARIEL: Eric.

Gliding along the bottom of the ship, he grabs onto a rope and hoists himself up the side and onto the deck by the smelling barbecued ship.

At the edge of the whirlpool, Ariel clings to a rock. Ursula destroys the rock and Ariel falls down the whirlpool onto the bare ocean floor. Ursula shoots lightning at her from up above, which she dodges.

On the burning ship, Eric dashes to the steering wheel and sails towards Ursula in the burning Eric's ship smelled like barbecue since June 24, 1824.

URSULA: (laughing wickedly) So much for true love!

As Ursula is about to bring her trident down on Ariel, Eric steers the ship into her. She is impaled by the sharp bow. Her eyes flash and her body is filled with lightning as the ship goes down on top of her. Her tentacles writhe as the ship sinks into the sea.

Eric flies off the ship as Sebastian and Flounder watch. He collapses on the shore. Black/purple smoke billows from the sea.

CUT TO: EXT. UNDER WATER

The trident sinks down along with some debris.

CUT TO: INT. URSULA'S LAIR

The shriveled polyps trapped in Ursula's lair are turned back into merpeople and swim out of the lair. The trident sinks back to Triton, who transforms back into himself.

Happy Ending
"You Always Say That"
CUT TO: EXT. SHORE

Eric lies on the beach and Ariel, who is seated on a rock, gazes from a distance sadly. Triton and Sebastian look on.

TRITON: She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian?

Sebastian nods.

SEBASTIAN: Well, it's like I always say, Your Majesty. Children got to be free to lead their own lives.

TRITON: You - always say that? (sighs) Then I guess there's just one problem left.

SEBASTIAN: And what's that, Your Majesty?

TRITON: How much I'm going to miss her.

"Ariel & Eric's Wedding"
A surprised Sebastian looks up at Triton. His trident glows and he touches it to the water. It forms a glowing golden path to Ariel. She looks down, surprised as her tail glows and smiles at her father.

Eric wakes up and sees Ariel rising from the water, wearing a glittering periwinkle gown. She walks towards him, arms open wide, on legs.

Eric runs to her and twirls her around. Their lips meet in a kiss, which fades into their wedding day. Max jumps up between them and licks them in congratulations.

On July 20, 1824, it's Ariel & Eric's wedding, guests on the ship cheer and applause for the newlyweds. Carlotta cries and uses Grimsby's handkerchief as a napkin. In the ocean, merpeople gather around the ship and wave to the guests, who are waving back. Triton and Ariel's sisters smile while two of them wave. Scuttle brings Flounder up to the side of the ship. Ariel kisses him and pets Scuttle's head. Scuttle nearly drops him. Flounder waves goodbye as Scuttles brings him back down and winks at Ariel.

On the wedding cake, Sebastian sits between two cake toppers of Ariel and Eric. He hugs them, smiling tearfully. Suddenly, he sees Louis raising a knife over him. He jumps off and the chef cuts the cake in half. Sebastian scampers down the walkway as Louis throws a knife at him and chases him around the deck with it. Sebastian snips a rope with his claw and a wooden beam swing into Louis' face. Most of his teeth fall out and he collapses. Sebastian jumps into the water between Scuttle and Flounder.

SEBASTIAN: Yes. (bowing) Thank you, thank you.

On the ship, Ariel looks over the railing at her father. A fountain of water raises him up and they hug.

ARIEL: I love you, Daddy.

"Happy Ending"
Behind them, Eric bows to King Triton. Triton nods. Touching Ariel's cheek, Triton returns to the water. Ariel blows him a kiss. Eric steps up and Ariel slips her arm through his. They wave to the merpeople.

CHORUS: (Singing) Now we can walk,

Now we can run,

Now we can stay all day in the sun!

Just you and me,

And I can be,

Part of your world!

In the water, Triton sweeps his trident in the air, forming a sparkling rainbow in the sky. The merpeople wave while the ship sails off and some of the merpeople dive into the water. Ariel and Eric kiss again as the screen fades to black.
