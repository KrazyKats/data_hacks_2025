Evil Queen: Slave in the Magic Mirror, come from the farthest space. Through wind and darkness, I summon thee. Speak! Let me see thy face.

Magic Mirror: What wouldst thou know, my Queen?

Evil Queen: Magic Mirror on the Wall, who is the fairest one of all?

Magic Mirror: Famed is thy beauty, Majesty. But hold, a lovely maid I see. Rags cannot hide her gentle grace. Alas, she is more fair than thee.

Evil Queen: Alas for her! Reveal her name.

Magic Mirror: Lips red as the rose, hair black as ebony, skin white as snow.

Evil Queen: (in horror) Snow White!

Snow White: (spoken) Wanna know a secret? Promise not to tell?

(sung)

We are standing by a wishing well

Make a wish into the well

That's all you have to do

And if you hear it echoing

Your wish will soon come true

I'm wishing

(I'm wishing)

For the one I love

To find me

(To find me)

Today

(Today)

I'm hoping

(I'm hoping)

And I'm dreaming of

The nice things

(The nice things)

He'll say

(He'll say)

(vocalizing)

I'm wishing

(I'm wishing)

For the one I love

To find me

(To find me)

Today...

Prince: Today!

Snow White: Oh!

Prince: Hello.

Snow White: Oh.

Prince: Did I frighten you? Wait. Wait, please! Don't run away!

(sung)

Now that I've found you

Here's what I have to say

One Song

I have but one song

One song

Only for you

One heart

Tenderly beating

Ever entreating

Constant and true

One love

That has possessed me

One love

Thrilling me through

One song

My heart keeps singing

Of one love

Only for you

Evil Queen: Take her far into the forest. Find some secluded glade, where she can pick wildflowers.

Huntsman: Yes, your Majesty.

Evil Queen: And there, my faithful Huntsman, you will kill her!

Huntsman: But, your Majesty, the little princess!

Evil Queen: Silence! You know the penalty if you fail.

Huntsman: Yes, your Majesty.

Evil Queen: But to make doubly sure, you do not fail. Bring back her heart in this.

(The Queen then takes out a jeweled box and showed it to the camera as it zooms to it as the scene fades to black.)

One song

I have but one song

Snow White: Hello there, what's the matter? Where's your mama and papa? Why, I believe you're lost. Oh, please don't cry. C'mon, perk up. Won't you smile for me? That's better. Your mama and papa can't be far. There they are! Can you fly? Goodbye. Goodbye!

Huntsman: I can't! I can't do it! Forgive me. I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.

Snow White: I don't understand!

Huntsman: She's mad, jealous of you! She'll stop at nothing!

Snow White: But, but who?

Huntsman: The Queen!

Snow White: (shocked) The Queen?!

Huntsman: Now run, child. Run, run away! Hide, in the woods anywhere! Never come back. Now, go. Go! Go! Run! Run! Hide everywhere!

Snow White: (spoken) Oh! PLEASE, don't run away! I won't hurt you! I'm awfully sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you. But you don't know what I've been through. And all because I was afraid... I'm so ashamed of this fuss I've made. What do you do when things go wrong?

(Bird twitters a tune)

Snow White: Oh! You sing a song!

(sung)

With a smile and a song

Life is just a bright sunny day

Your cares fade away

And your heart is young

With a smile and a song

All the world seems to waken anew

Rejoicing with you

As the song is sung

There's no use in grumbling

When raindrops come tumbling

Remember, you're the one

Who can fill the world with sunshine

When you smile and you sing

Everything is in tune and it's spring

And life flows along

With a smile and a song

Snow White: (spoken) I really feel quite happy now. I'm sure I'll get along somehow. Everything's going to be alright. But I do need a place to sleep, at night. Oh [giggles] I can't sleep on the ground like you, Or in a tree the way you do. And I'm sure no nest could possibly be big enough for me. Maybe you know where I can stay. In the woods somewhere? (birds tweet) You do?! (birds tweet) Will you take me there? I like it here. Ooh, it's dark inside. Guess there's no one home. Hello, may I come in? Shh. (gasps) What a cute little chair. Why there's 7 little chairs. Must be 7 little children. And from the look of this table, 7 untidy little children. A pick-axe! A stocking, too! (looks inside one of the pots) And a shoe! And just look at that fireplace. It's covered with dust. And look, cobwebs everywhere. My, my, my! What a pile of dirty dishes. And just look at that broom. Why, they've never swept this room. You'd their mother would------maybe they have no mother. Then they're orphans. That's too bad! I know. We'll clean the house and surprise them. Then maybe they'll let me stay.

(spoken)

Now you wash the dishes, you tidy up the room

You clean the fireplace, and I will use the Broom

Just whistle while you work

And cheerfully together we can tidy up the place

So hum a merry tune

It won’t take long when there's a song

To help you set the pace

And as you sweep the room

Imagine that the broom is someone that you love

And soon you’ll find you're dancing to the tune

(Spoken: Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.)

When hearts are high the time will fly

So whistle while you work

(instrumental break)

(Spoken: Ah, ah, ah, ah! Not under the rug.)

(instrumental break continues)

So whistle while you work

We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig

In our mine the whole day through

To dig dig dig dig dig dig dig

Is what we like to do

It ain't no trick to get rich quick

If ya dig dig dig with a shovel or a pick

In a mine! In a mine! In a mine! In a mine!

Where a million diamonds shine!

We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig

From early morn till night

We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig up

Everything in sight

We dig up diamonds by the score

Thousand rubies, sometimes more

Though we don't know what we dig 'em for

We dig dig dig a-dig dig

Snow White: Let's see what's upstairs. Oh, what adorable little beds! And look, they have their names carved on them. Doc? Happy? Sneezy? Dopey? Huh. What funny names for children. Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy. (yawns) I'm a little sleepy myself.

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho

[Whistle]

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, Heigh-- (Doc: Look!)

Doc: Our house! The lit's light, er, the light's lit!

Dwarfs: Jiminy Crickets!

Doc: The door is open.

Happy: The chimney's smoking.

Sneezy: Something's in there.

Happy: Perhaps a ghost.

Bashful: Or a goblin.

Doc: A demon.

Sleepy: Or a dragon.

Grumpy: Mark my words, there's trouble a-brewing. Felt it coming all day. (points to his foot) My corns hurt.

Happy: Gawrsh!

Bashful: That's a bad sign. (to Doc and Sleepy) What do we do?

Happy: Let's sneak up on it.

Doc: Yes. We'll, uh, squeak up, uh, sneak up. C'mon, hen, uh, men. Follow me.

(The dwarfs, led by Doc, all tiptoe silently towards the cottage with raised picks and slightly frightened expressions. Dopey, who is last in line as usual, is the most frightened. As they reach the cottage, Doc cautiously peers into the crack in the front door and beckons the others to come closer)

Doc: Psst.

(Doc slowly opens the door and looks around. The other dwarfs pile in around him, with Dopey peeking out through Sleepy's beard. Seeing that the coast is clear, the dwarfs tiptoe slowly inside, their shoes squeaking on the clean floor and Sleepy steps on Dopey as they enter. Then the mute dwarf picks himself up and shuts the door. THUD!! The noise alarms the others so many, they jump and scramble around frantically. As they see it's only Dopey locking the door, they calm down)

Dwarfs: Shhh!

(Dopey nods, but turns towards the door)

Dopey: Shhh!

Doc: Careful, men. Search every cook and nanny, er, hook and granny, uh, crook and fan--- Search everywhere.

(Then the dwarfs split up, their shoes yet squeaking. From up in the rafters, the bluebird family watches them sneaking around, looking for whatever's in their house. From a window, Mrs. Deer, a rabbit and two chipmunks also watch, ducking briefly out of sight as two of them pass by. After a few seconds, one of them following Doc makes a loud creaking sound, and they stop short)

Doc: Shh, quiet!

(About three steps later, Doc, followed by Sneezy and Sleepy, stops and looks down on the newly-cleaned floor)

Doc: Look! The floor, it's been swept!

Grumpy: Chair's been dusted!

Happy: Our window's been washed.

Bashful: Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.

Doc: Why, why, why, why, the whole place is clean!

Grumpy: There's dirty work afoot.

Sneezy: Sink's empty. Hey, someone stole our dishes!

Happy: They ain't stole. They're hid in the cupboard.

Bashful: My cup's been washed. Sugar's gone.

Happy: Something's cooking. Smells good!

Grumpy: Don't touch it, you fools! Might be poison. See? It's witches' brew.

Doc: Look what's happened to our stable... Table.

Bashful: Flowers!

Sneezy: Huh?

Bashful: Look, goldenrod.

Sneezy: Don't do it. Take them away. My nose! My hay fever! You know I can't stand it. I can't... I can't... I... Oh. Thanks! (sneezes)

Grumpy: Hey!

Dwarfs: Shhh!

Grumpy: Ya crazy fool! Fine time you picked to sneeze!

Sneezy: I couldn't help it. I can't tell. When you gotta, you gotta. I... I... I gotta. It's coming.

Dwarfs: Don't let him. Stop him.

Sneezy: Oh!

Dwarfs: No, tie it tight. Don't let go. Hold him tight. I'll tie it. Make a hard knot.

Happy: There, that will hold him.

Sneezy: Thanks!

Grumpy: Quiet, you fool! You want to get us all killed?

Happy: What's that?

Doc: That's it.

Bashful: Sounded close.

Grumpy: It's in this room right now.

Doc: It's up there.

Bashful: Yeah. In the bedroom.

Doc: One of us has gotta go down and chase it up. Up. Down. Here, take it. Don't be nervous. Don't be afraid. We're right behind you.

Other Dwarfs: Yes! Right behind ya.

Grumpy: Here it comes!

Sneezy: It's after us.

Bashful: Don't let it out.

Grumpy: Hold it shut.

Dwarfs: Here it comes. Now's our chance. Get it now! Quick! Give it to it! Don't let it get away!

Grumpy: Take that, and that, and that!

Doc: Hold on there. It's only Dopey.

Sneezy: Did you see it?

Happy: How big is it?

Grumpy: Was it a dragon?

Sneezy: Has it got horns?

Grumpy: Was it breathing fire?

Happy: Was it droolin'?

Sneezy: What was it doin'?

Doc: He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds!

Grumpy: Let's attack.

Sneezy: While it's sleeping.

Dwarfs: Yeah, while it's sleeping.

Doc: Hurry, men. It's now or never!

Happy: Off with its head.

Bashful: Break its bones.

Sneezy: Chop it to pieces.

Grumpy: We'll kill it dead.

Sneezy: Jiminy Crickets!

Bashful: Gosh!

Happy: Gee!

Sneezy: What a monster!

Bashful: It covers three beds.

Doc: Let's kill it before it wakes up.

Happy: Which end do we kill?

Doc: Shh!

Dwarfs: Shh!

Doc: Well, eh, ah...

Happy: What is it?

Doc: Why, it... It's a girl!

Sneezy: She's mighty purdy.

Bashful: She's beautiful, just like a angel.

Grumpy: Angel, hah! She's a female! And all females is poison! They're full of wicked wiles.

Bashful: What are wicked wiles?

Grumpy: I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.

Doc: Shh! Not so loud. You'll wake her up.

Grumpy: Let her wake up! She don't belong here nohow.

Doc: Shh!

Bashful: Look out.

Sneezy: She's movin'.

Happy: She's wakin' up.

Sneezy: What'll we do?

Doc: Hide.

Snow White: Oh, dear. I wonder if the children are... Oh! Why, why, you're little men! How do you do? I said, how do you do?

Grumpy: How do you do what?

Snow White: Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad! Now, don't tell me who you are. Let me guess. I know, you're Doc.

Doc: Why, why, why, yes. Yes! That's true.

Snow White: And you're, you're Bashful.

Bashful: Oh, gosh!

Snow White: And you, you're Sleepy.

Sleepy: How'd you guess?

Snow White: And you?

Sneezy: Ah…ah-ch…ah-ch…ah…

Snow White: And you're Sneezy.

Sneezy: Phew…ah-choo!

Snow White: Yes, and you must be...

Happy: Happy, ma'am. That's me. And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.

Snow White: You mean he can't talk?

Happy: He don't know. He never tried.

Snow White: Oh, that's too bad. Oh! You must be Grumpy.

Doc: Oh, yes! Yes!

Grumpy: Hah! We know who we are. Ask her who she is and what she's a-doin' here.

Doc: Yeah! What are you and who are you doin'? What are you... Who are you, my dear?

Snow White: Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.

Happy: Snow White?

Dwarfs: The Princess?

Snow White: Yes.

Doc: Well... Well, my, my dear Quincess... Princess. We're, we're honoured. Yes, we're, we're...

Grumpy: Mad as hornets!

Doc: Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not. We're bad as cornets... No, no, as bad as... What was I sayin'?

Grumpy: Nothing! Just standin' there sputterin' like a doodlebug!

Doc: Who, who, who, who's butterin' like a spoodledug? Who's... Gutter...

Grumpy: Shut up and tell her to get out!

Snow White: Please don't send me away! If you do, she'll kill me.

Dwarfs: Kill you? Who will? Yes, who?

Snow White: My stepmother, the Queen.

Dwarfs: The Queen?

Bashful: She's wicked!

Happy: She's bad!

Sneezy: She's mighty mean!

Grumpy: She's an old witch! I'm warnin' ya. If the Queen finds her here, she'll swoop down and wreak her vengeance on us!

Snow White: But she doesn't know where I am!

Grumpy: She don't, eh? She knows everything. She's full of black magic. She can even make herself invisible. Might be in this room right now.

Snow White: Oh, she'll never find me here. And if you let me stay, I'll keep house for you. I'll wash and sew and sweep and cook and...

Dwarfs: Cook?

Doc: Can you make dapple lumpkins... Lumple dapplins?

Dwarfs: Apple dumplings!

Doc: Eh, yes! Crapple dumpkins.

Snow White: Yes, and plum pudding and gooseberry pie...

Dwarfs: Gooseberry pie? Hooray! She stays! Soup! Hooray!

Snow White: Just a minute. Supper's not quite ready. You'll just have time to wash.

Dwarfs: Wash? Wash? Wash? Wash? Wash?

Grumpy: Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.

Bashful: Why wash?

Happy: What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.

Doc: 'Tain't New Year's.

Snow White: Oh, perhaps you have washed.

Doc: Perhaps we... Yes! Perhaps we have.

Snow White: But when?

Doc: When? When. You said whe... Why, last week. Why, recently!

Dwarfs: Yes, recently!

Snow White: Oh, recently! Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands! Why, Doc, I'm surprised! Come on, let's see them. Oh, Bashful, my, my, my! And you? Worse than I thought! How shocking! Goodness me, this will never do. March straight outside and wash, or you'll not get a bite to eat. Well, aren't you going to wash? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Did you hurt yourself?

Grumpy: Hah, women!

Doc: Courage, men, courage. Don't be nervous.

Happy: Gosh, it's wet!

Sneezy: It's cold, too!

Bashful: We ain't gonna do it, are we?

Doc: Well, it'll please the Princess.

Happy: I'll take a chance for her!

Bashful, Sneezy & Sleepy: Me, too!

Grumpy: Hah! Her wiles are beginnin' to work. But I'm warnin' ya, you give 'em an inch, and they'll walk all over ya!

Doc: Don't listen to that old warthog.

Doc: Come on, now men.

Sneezy: How hard do you scrub?

Sleepy: Will our whiskers shrink?

Happy: Do you get in the tub?

Bashful: Do you have to wash where it doesn't show?

Doc: Now, now, don't get excited. Here we go.

Step up to the tub - 'Tain't no disgrace

Just pull up your sleeves and get 'em in place

Then scoop up the water and rub it on your face

And go brrr, brrr, brrr

Pick up the soap - now, don't try to bluff

Work up a lather, an' when ya got enough

Get your hands full of water, ya snort and ya snuff

And go brrr, brrr, brrr

Ya douse and ya souse

Rub and ya scrub

Ya sputter and splash all over the tub

You may be cold and wet when you're done

But ya gotta admit it's good clean fun

So splash all ya like - 'Tain't any trick

As soon as you're through you'll feel mighty slick

Grumpy: Bunch of old nanny goats, ya make me sick

Goin' brrr, brrr, brrr

Grumpy: Hah! Next thing ya know... ...she'll be tyin' your beards up in pink ribbons... ...and smellin' ya up with that stuff called "perfoom." A fine bunch of water lilies you turned out to be. I'd like to see anybody make me wash if I didn't wanna.

(Whistle verse)

Doc: Get him!

Grumpy: Hey, let go of me!

Doc: Get him over to the tub. Get him over to the tub.

Grumpy: Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose!

Doc: Get him up on the tub. Get him up! Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him! Get him up on the tub! On the tub. That's the tub. That's the tub. Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited! Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get... Get the soap! Hey, steady, men. We'll get him there.

Dwarfs: We'll get him. Never say die. Never say die. You don't...

(Later, as the Dwarfs are forcibly washing Grumpy)

Doc: Now scrub good and hard, it can't be denied

That he'll look mighty cute as soon as he's dried

Dwarfs: But it's good for the soul and it's good for the hide to go

Grumpy: Brrr, brrr, brrr

Bashful: Ain't he sweet?

Sneezy: Smells like a petunia.

Happy: He sure is cute!

Grumpy: You'll pay dearly for this!

Snow White: Supper!

Doc: Supper!

Dwarfs: Food. Hooray!

Grumpy: Brrr, brrr, brrr! Hah!

Evil Queen: Magic Mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?

Magic Mirror: Over the seven jewelled hills beyond the seventh fall, in the cottage of the seven dwarfs dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.

Evil Queen: Snow White lies dead in the forest. The Huntsman has brought me proof. Behold her heart.

Magic Mirror: Snow White still lives, the fairest in the land. 'Tis the heart of a pig you hold in your hand.

Evil Queen: The heart of a pig! Then I've been tricked! The heart of a pig! The blundering fool! I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage... ...in a disguise so complete... ...no one will ever suspect. Now, a formula to transform my beauty into ugliness, change my queenly raiment to a pedlar's cloak. Mummy dust to make me old. To shroud my clothes, the black of night. To age my voice, an old hag's cackle. To whiten my hair, a scream of fright. A blast of wind... ...to fan my hate! A thunderbolt... ...to mix it well. Now, begin thy magic spell. Look! My hands!

Witch: My voice! My voice. A perfect disguise. And now... A special sort of death... ...for one so fair. What shall it be? A poisoned apple! Sleeping Death. "One taste of the Poisoned Apple, and the victim's eyes will close forever in the Sleeping Death."

(Yodel:)

Ho-la-la-ee-ay

Ho-la-la-ee-ay

Ho-la-la-ee-ay-ee-la-ee-ay-ee-lee-ay

Ho-la-la-ee-ay

Ho-la-la-ee-ay

Ho-la-la-ee-ay-ee-la-lee-ay-lee-o-lee-ay

(repeat)

Happy: I'd like to dance and tap my feet

But they won't keep in rhythm

You see, I washed them both today

And I can't do nothing with 'em

(Chorus)

Ho hum, the tune is dumb

The words don't mean a thing

Isn't this a silly song

For anyone to sing?

Bashful: I... oh, g-g-g-gosh!

I chased a polecat up a tree

Way out upon a limb

And when he got the best of me

I got the worst of him

(Chorus)

Ho hum, the tune is dumb

The words don't mean a thing

Isn't this a silly song

For anyone to sing?

(Yodel, etc.)

Sneezy: Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch... Watch... Watch... Thanks.

(Yodel, etc.)

Dwarfs: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hooray!

(Sneezy sneezing)

(Dwarfs laughing)

Snow White: (chuckling) That was fun!

Happy: Now you do something.

Snow White: Well, what shall I do?

Sleepy: Tell us a story.

Dwarfs: Yes, tell us a story.

Happy: A true story.

Bashful: A love story.

Snow White: Well, once there was a princess–

Doc: Was the princess...you?

Snow White: And she fell in love.

Sneezy: Was it hard to do?

Snow White: It was very easy. Anyone could see that the prince was charming. The only one for me.

Doc: Was he, uh, strong and handsome?

Sneezy: Was he big and tall?

Snow White: There's nobody like him. Anywhere at all.

Bashful: Did he say he loved ya?

Happy: Did he steal a kiss?

Snow White: He was so romantic,

I could not resist.

Someday my prince will come

Someday we'll meet again

And away to his castle we'll go

To be happy forever, I know

Grumpy: Heh. Mush!

Snow White: Someday when spring is here

We'll find our love anew

And the birds will sing,

And wedding bells will ring

Someday when my dreams come true

Snow White: Oh, my goodness! It's past bedtime. Go right upstairs to bed.

Doc: Wait! Hold on there, men! The Princess will sleep in our beds upstairs.

Snow White: But where will you sleep?

Doc: Oh, we'll be quite comfortable down here in... in...

Grumpy: In a pig's eye!

Doc: In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no! I mean... We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?

Dwarfs: Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.

Doc: Now don't you worry about us.

Happy: We'll be all right, ma'am.

Doc: Go right on up now, my dear.

Snow White: Well, if you insist. Good night.

Dwarfs: Good night, Princess.

Snow White: You're sure you'll be comfortable?

Dwarfs: Oh, yes. Very comfortable.

Snow White: Well, pleasant dreams.

Dwarfs: Pleasant dreams.

Dwarfs (minus Doc): Let go! I saw it first!

Doc: Now, men, don't get excited. Remember, share. It's share and share alike. Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!

Snow White: Bless the seven little men who have been so kind to me. And... And may my dreams come true. Amen. Oh, yes! And please make Grumpy like me.

Grumpy: Hah! Women! A fine kettle of fish!

Witch: Dip the apple in the brew. Let the Sleeping Death seep through! Look! On the skin! The symbol of what lies within. Now, turn red to tempt Snow White. To make her hunger for a bite. Have a bite? It's not for you. It's for Snow White. When she breaks the tender peel... ...to taste the apple in my hand, her breath will still, her blood congeal. Then I'll be fairest in the land! But wait! There may be an antidote. Nothing must be overlooked. Oh, here it is! "The victim of the Sleeping Death can be revived only by Love's First Kiss." "Love's First Kiss." No fear of that. The dwarfs will think she's dead. She'll be buried alive! Buried alive! Thirsty? Have a drink!

Doc: Now, don't forget, my dear. The... The old Queen's a sly one, full of witchcraft. So beware of strangers.

Snow White: Don't worry. I'll be all right. See you tonight.

Doc: Yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.

Bashful: Be awful careful... ...'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...

Snow White: Good-bye.

Bashful: Oh, gosh!

Grumpy: Hah! Disgustin'!

Sneezy: And be sure to watch out... To wa... To wa... To wa... Watch out. Thanks. (sneezing)

Snow White: Well... All right. But that's the last... Wha... Oh, go on. Run along.

[Chorus]: Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho

It's off to work we go

[Whistle]

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho

Snow White: Good-bye! Good-bye!

Grumpy: Now I'm warnin' ya. Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.

Snow White: Why, Grumpy, you do care. Good-bye, Grumpy!

Witch: The little men will be away... ...and she'll be all alone... ...with a harmless old pedlar woman. A harmless old pedlar woman!

Someday my prince will come

Someday we'll meet again

And away to his castle we'll go

To be happy forever, I know

Someday when spring is here

We'll find our love anew

And the birds will sing,

And wedding bells will ring

Someday when my dreams come true

Witch: All alone, my pet?

Snow White: Why, why, yes, I am. But...

Witch: The, the little men are not here?

Snow White: No, they're not, but...

Witch: Making pies?

Snow White: Yes, gooseberry pies.

Witch: It's apple pies... ...that make the menfolks' mouths water. Pies made from apples like these.

Snow White: Oh, they do look delicious.

Witch: Yes! But wait 'til you taste one, dearie. Like to try one? Go on. Go on, have a bite.

Snow White: Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away! Shame on you, frightening a poor old lady.

Witch: Oh, I thought I'd lost it.

Snow White: There, there. I'm sorry.

Witch: Oh! My heart! Oh, my... My poor heart. Take me into the house and let me rest. A drink of water, please.

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho

[Chorus]: Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho

It's off to work we go

[Whistle]

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho

[Whistle]

Doc: Hey, look! Stop that! Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!

Grumpy: Go on! Get outta here!

Doc: What ails these crazy birds?

Bashful: They've gone plumb daffy.

Sneezy: Yeah, they've... (sneezing)

Witch: And because you've been so good to poor old Granny, I'll share a secret with you. This is no ordinary apple. It's a magic wishing apple.

Snow White: A wishing apple?

Witch: Yes! One bite and all your dreams will come true.

Snow White: Really?

Witch: Yes, girlie. Now, make a wish... ...and take a bite.

Happy: Go on, get!

Bashful: These pesky critters won't stop.

Doc: 'Tain't natural. There's something wrong.

Grumpy: They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.

Sleepy: Maybe the old Queen's got Snow White.

Doc: The Queen!

Dwarfs: Snow White!

Grumpy: The Queen'll kill her! We gotta save her!

Doc: Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!

Sneezy: She'll kill her!

Happy: What'll we do?

Doc: Yes, yes, what'll we do?

Grumpy: Come on! Giddap!

Doc: Wait for me! Wait for...

Witch: There must be something your little heart desires. Perhaps there's someone you love.

Snow White: Well, there is someone.

Witch: I thought so. I thought so! Old Granny knows a young girl's heart. Now, take the apple, dearie, and make a wish.

Snow White: I wish... I wish...

Witch: That's it, go on! Go on.

Snow White: And that he will carry me away to his castle... ...where we will live happily ever after.

Witch: Fine! Fine! Now take a bite. Don't let the wish grow cold!

Snow White: Oh, I feel strange.

Witch: Her breath will still.

Snow White: Oh. Oh.

Witch: Her blood congeal.

Snow White: Oh.

Witch: Now I'll be fairest in the land!

Dwarfs: Hurry, hurry.

Grumpy: There she goes! After her!

Witch: I'm trapped! What will I do? The meddling little fools! I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!

Grumpy: Look out!

Witch: (cackles and screams)

(Dwarfs weeping)

One song (one song), I have but one song

One song (one song) only for you (for you)

One heart tenderly beating

Ever entreating, constant and true (so true)

One love (one love) that has possessed me

One love (one love) thrilling me through (so true)

One song (one song) my heart keeps singing (keeps singing)

Of one love (one love), only for you

And away to his castle you'll go

To be happy forever, we know

Snow White: Good-bye. Good-bye, Grumpy. Good-bye. Oh, Dopey. Good-bye!

Someday when spring is here

We'll find our love anew

And the birds will sing,

And wedding bells will ring

Someday when my dreams come true!
